# Overview

This appendix gives a very brief introduction to calculus with a focus on the tools needed in physics. 
 
:::{hint} Learning Objectives
* Understand the trinket.io platform
* Understand how to create and position objects in trinket.
* Understand how to create motion with objects in trinket.
:::

# Code in this textbook
When referring to general ideas or something very brief, Visual Python code may be written in-line. For example, ```this is a general code example```. When giving explicit code to be implemented, Visual Python code will be written in "display mode". For example,
```python
This code is meant to be implemented into a trinket.
```
The distinction should become clear as you work through this appendix.
