% Choose between "biorxiv", "medrxiv", "arxiv" and "chemrxiv". Otherwise defaults "Preprint".
% Choose between "blue" and "red" colour scheme. Defaults to "blue".
% Use the "onehalfspacing" option for 1.5 line spacing.
% Use the "doublespacing" option for 2.0 line spacing.
% Use the "lineno" option for line numbers.
% Use the "endfloat" option to place floats after the bibliography.
% Use the "secnum" option to have include numbers.

%%% SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL / APPENDICES

%% Sadly, we can't use floats in the appendix boxes. So they don't "float", but use \captionof{figure}{...} and \captionof{table}{...} to get them properly caption.
