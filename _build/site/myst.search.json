It is important to note that describing the world around us is not the same as explaining the world around us. Science aims to answer the question “How?” and not the question “Why?”. As we develop our description of the physical world, you should remember this important distinction and resist the urge to ask “Why?”.\n\nThe Scientific Method is a prescription for coming up with a description of the physical world that anyone can challenge and improve through performing experiments. If we come up with a description that can describe many observations, or the outcome of many different experiments, then we usually call that description a “Scientific Theory”. We can get some insight into the Scientific Method through a simple example.\n\nImagine that we wish to describe how long it takes for a tennis ball to reach the ground after being released from a certain height. One way to proceed is to describe how long it takes for a tennis ball to drop 1 {\\rm m}, and then to describe how long it takes for a tennis ball to drop 2 {\\rm m}, etc. We could generate a giant table showing how long it takes a tennis ball to drop from any given height. Someone would then be able to perform an experiment to measure how long a tennis ball takes to drop from 1 {\\rm m} or 2 {\\rm m} and see if their measurement disagrees with the tabulated values. If we collected the descriptions for all possible heights, then we would effectively have a valid and testable scientific theory that describes how long it takes tennis balls to drop from any height.\n\nSuppose that a budding scientist, let’s call her Chloe, then came along and noticed that there is a pattern in the theory that can be described much more succinctly and generally than by using a giant table. In particular, suppose that she notices that, mathematically, the time, t, that it takes for a tennis ball to drop a height, h, is proportional to the square root of the height:t \\propto \\sqrt{h}\n\nExample\n\nUse Chloe’s Theory (t \\propto \\sqrt{h}) to determine how much longer it will take for an object to drop by 2 {\\rm m} than it would to drop by 1 {\\rm m}.\n\nSolution\n\nWhen we have a proportionality law (with a ∝) sign, we can always change this to an equal sign by introducing a constant, which we will call k:t &\\propto \\sqrt{h} \\\\\n\\rightarrow t&=k\\sqrt{h}\n\nLet t_1 be the time to fall a distance h_1=1 {\\rm m}, and t_2 be the time to fall a distance h_2=2 {\\rm m}. In terms of our unknown constant, k, we have:t_1 &=k\\sqrt{h_1}=k \\sqrt{(1 {\\rm m})}\\\\\nt_2 &=k\\sqrt{h_2}=k \\sqrt{(2 {\\rm m})}\\\\\n\nBy taking the ratio, \\frac{t_1}{t_2}, our unknown constant k will cancel:\\frac{t_1}{t_2}&=\\frac{\\sqrt{(1 {\\rm m})}}{\\sqrt{(2 {\\rm m})}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\\\\n\\therefore t_2 &= \\sqrt{2} t_1\n\nand we find that it will take \\sqrt{2}\\sim 1.41 times longer to drop by 2 {\\rm m} than it will by 1 {\\rm m}.\n\nChloe’s “Theory of Tennis Ball Drop Times” is appealing because it is succinct, and it also allows us to make verifiable predictions. That is, using this theory, we can predict that it will take a tennis ball \\sqrt 2 times longer to drop from 2 {\\rm m} than it will from 1 {\\rm m}, and then perform an experiment to verify that prediction. If the experiment agrees with the prediction, then we conclude that Chloe’s theory adequately describes the result of that particular experiment. If the experiment does not agree with the prediction, then we conclude that the theory is not an adequate description of that experiment, and we try to find a new theory.\n\nChloe’s theory is also appealing because it can describe not only tennis balls, but the time it takes for other objects to fall as well. Scientists can then set out to continue testing her theory with a wide range of objects and drop heights to see if it describes those experiments as well. Inevitably, they will discover situations where Chloe’s theory fails to adequately describe the time that it takes for objects to fall (can you think of an example?).\n\nWe would then develop a new “Theory of Falling Objects” that would include Chloe’s theory that describes most objects falling, and additionally, a set of descriptions for the fall times for cases that are not described by Chloe’s theory. Ideally, we would seek a new theory that would also describe the new phenomena not described by Chloe’s theory in a succinct manner. There is of course no guarantee, ever, that such a theory would exist; it is just an optimistic hope of physicists to find the most general and succinct description of the physical world. This is a general difference between physics and many of the other sciences. In physics, one always tries to arrive at a succinct theory (e.g. an equation) that can describe many phenomena, whereas the other sciences are often very descriptive. For example, there is no succinct formula for how butterflies look; rather, there is a giant collection of observations of different butterflies.\n\nThis example highlights that applying the Scientific Method is an iterative process. Loosely, the prescription for applying the Scientific Method is:\n\nIdentify and describe a process that is not currently described by a theory.\n\nLook at similar processes to see if they can be described in a similar way.\n\nImprove the description to arrive at a “Theory” that can be generalized to make predictions.\n\nTest predictions of the theory on new processes until a prediction fails.\n\nImprove the theory.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nFill in the blanks: Physics is a branch of science that ___________ the behaviour of the universe. When doing physics, we attempt to answer the question of ___________ things work the way they do.\n\nexplains\n\ndescribes\n\nhow\n\nwhy\n\nAnswer\n\ndescribes\n\nhow","type":"content","url":"/introduction#science-and-the-scientific-method","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Theories, hypotheses and models"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/introduction#theories-hypotheses-and-models","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Theories, hypotheses and models"},"content":"For the purpose of this textbook (and science in general), we introduce a distinction in what we mean by “theory”, “hypothesis”, and by “model”. We will consider a “theory” to be a set of statements (or an equation) that gives us a broad description, applicable to several phenomena and that allows us to make verifiable predictions. For example, Chloe’s Theory (t \\propto \\sqrt{h}) can be considered a theory. Specifically, we do not use the word theory in the context of “I have a theory about this...”\n\nA “hypothesis” is a consequence of the theory that one can test. From Chloe’s Theory, we have the hypothesis that an object will take \\sqrt{2} times longer to fall from 1 {\\rm m} than from 2 {\\rm m}. We can formulate the hypothesis based on the theory and then test that hypothesis. If the hypothesis is found to be invalidated by experiment, then either the theory is incorrect, or the hypothesis is not consistent with the theory.\n\nA “model” is a situation-specific description of a phenomenon based on a theory, that allows us to make a specific prediction. Using the example from the previous section, our theory would be that the fall time of an object is proportional to the square root of the drop height, and a model would be applying that theory to describe a tennis ball falling by 4.2 {\\rm m}. From the model, we can form a testable hypothesis of how long it will take the tennis ball to fall that distance. It is important to note that a model will almost always be an approximation of the theory applied to describe a particular phenomenon. For example, if Chloe’s Theory is only valid in vacuum, and we use it to model the time that it takes for an object to fall at the surface of the Earth, we may find that our model disagrees with experiment. We would not necessarily conclude that the theory is invalidated, if our model did not adequately apply the theory to describe the phenomenon (e.g. by forgetting to include the effect of air drag).\n\nThis textbook will introduce the theories from Classical Physics, which were mostly established and tested between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. We will take it as given that readers of this textbook are not likely to perform experiments that challenge those well-established theories. The main challenge will be, given a theory, to define a model that describes a particular situation, and then to test that model. This introductory physics course is thus focused on thinking of “doing physics” as the task of correctly modelling a situation.\n\nEmma’s Thoughts\n\nWhat’s the difference between a model and a theory?\n“Model” and “Theory” are sometimes used interchangeably among scientists. In physics, it is particularly important to distinguish between these two terms. A model provides an immediate understanding of something based on a theory.\n\nFor example, if you would like to model the launch of your toy rocket into space, you might run a computer simulation of the launch based on various theories of propulsion that you have learned. In this case, the model is the computer simulation, which describes what will happen to the rocket. This model depends on various theories that have been extensively tested such as Newton’s Laws of motion, Fluid dynamics, etc.\n\n“Model”: Your homemade rocket computer simulation\n\n“Theory”: Newton’s Laws of motion, Fluid dynamics\n\nWith this analogy, we can quickly see that the “model” and “theory” are not interchangeable. If they were, we would be saying that all of Newton’s Laws of Motion depend on the success of your piddly toy rocket computer simulation!\n\nCheckpoint\n\nModels cannot be scientifically tested, only theories can be tested.}\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/introduction#theories-hypotheses-and-models","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Fighting intuition"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/introduction#fighting-intuition","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Fighting intuition"},"content":"It is important to remember to fight one’s intuition when applying the scientific method. Certain theories, such as Quantum Mechanics, are very counter-intuitive. For example, in Quantum Mechanics, an object can be described as being in two locations at the same time. In the Theory of Special Relativity, it is possible for two people to disagree on whether two events occurred at the same time. These particular predictions from these theories have not been invalidated by any experiment.\n\nThere is no requirement in science that a theory be “pretty” or intuitive. The only requirement is that a theory describe experimental data. One should then take care in not forcing one’s preconceived notions into interpreting a theory. For example, Quantum Mechanics does not actually predict that objects can be in two locations at once, only that objects behave as if they were in two locations at once. A famous example is Schr\"odinger’s cat, which can be modelled as being both alive and dead at the same time. However, just because we model it that way does not mean that it really is alive and dead at the same time.","type":"content","url":"/introduction#fighting-intuition","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/introduction#the-scope-of-physics","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"content":"Physics describes a wide range of phenomena within the physical sciences, ranging from the behaviour of microscopic particles that make up matter to the evolution of the entire Universe. We often distinguish between “classical” and “modern” physics depending on when the theories were developed, and we can further subdivide these areas of physics depending on the scale or the type of the phenomena that they describe.\n\nThe word physics comes from Ancient Greek and translates to “nature” or “knowledge of nature”. The goal of physics is to develop theories from which mathematical models can be derived to describe our observations. One of the ambitious goals of physicists is to develop a single theory that describes all of nature, instead of having multiple theories to describe different categories of phenomena. This is in stark contrast to other fields of science, as Rutherford famously quipped: “All science is either physics or stamp collecting”. That is, physicists hope that there exists one single mathematical theory (like Chloe’s theory of falling objects) that describes the entire physical world. In Biology, for example, this would not be a reasonable goal, as one needs to describe every single living being, and there is no overarching “theory of what all living things look like”. Currently, physicists have been able to narrow down the number of theories required to describe all of the physical world to only three, which is impressive (the theory of gravity, the theory of the strong nuclear force, and physicists have now further unified the weak nuclear force with electromagnetism to make the “electroweak force”).","type":"content","url":"/introduction#the-scope-of-physics","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Classical Physics","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/introduction#classical-physics","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Classical Physics","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"content":"This textbook is focused on classical physics, which corresponds to the theories that were developed before 1905.\n\\subsubsection{Mechanics}\nMechanics describes most of our everyday experiences, such as how objects move, including how planets move under the influence of gravity. Isaac Newton was the first to formally develop a theory of mechanics, using his “Three Laws” to describe the behaviour of objects in our everyday experience. His famous work published in 1687, “Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica” (“The Principia”) also included a theory of gravity that describes the motion of celestial objects.\n\nFollowing the 1781 discovery of the planet Uranus by William Herschel, astronomers noticed that the orbit of the planet was not well described by Newton’s theory. This led Urbain Le Verrier (in Paris) and John Couch Adams (in Cambridge) to predict the location of a new planet that was disturbing the orbit of Uranus rather than to claim that Newton’s theory was incorrect. The planet Neptune was subsequently discovered by Le Verrier in 1846, one year after the prediction, and seen as a resounding confirmation of Newton’s theory.\n\nIn 1859, Urbain Le Verrier also noted that Mercury’s orbit around the Sun is different than that predicted by Newton’s theory. Again, a new planet was proposed, “Vulcan”, but that planet was never discovered and the deviation of Mercury’s orbit from Newton’s prediction remained unexplained until 1915, when Albert Einstein introduced a new, more complete, theory of gravity, called “General Relativity”. This is a good example of the scientific method; although the discovery of Neptune was consistent with Newton’s theory, it did not prove that the theory is correct, only that it correctly described the motion of Uranus. The discrepancy that arose when looking at Mercury ultimately showed that Newtons’ theory of gravity fails to provide a proper description of planetary orbits in the proximity of very massive objects (Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat did the inability to find the planet Vulcan show:}\n\nIt showed that Newton’s model of Mercury was correct.\n\nIt showed that Newton’s theory did not correctly describe the orbits of all planets.\n\nIt showed that the technology at the time was inadequate.\n\nIt showed that Einstein’s theory of General Relativity was correct.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/introduction#classical-physics","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Electromagnetism","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/introduction#electromagnetism","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Electromagnetism","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"content":"Electromagnetism describes electric charges and magnetism. At first, it was not realized that electricity and magnetism were connected. Charles Augustin de Coulomb published in 1784 the first description of how electric charges attract and repel each other. Magnetism was discovered in the ancient world, when people noticed that lodestone (rocks made from magnetized magnetite mineral) could attract iron tools. In 1819, Oersted discovered that moving electric charges could influence a compass needle, and several subsequent experiments were carried out to discover how magnets and moving electric charges interact.\n\nIn 1865, James Clerk Maxwell published “A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field”, wherein he first proposed a theory that unified electricity and magnetism as two facets of the same phenomenon. One important concept from Maxwell’s theory is that light is an electromagnetic wave with a well-defined speed. This uncovered some potential issues with the theory as it required an absolute frame of reference in which to describe the propagation of light. Experiments in the late 1800s failed to detect the existence of this frame of reference.","type":"content","url":"/introduction#electromagnetism","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Modern Physics","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/introduction#modern-physics","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Modern Physics","lvl2":"The scope of Physics"},"content":"In 1905, Albert Einstein published three major papers that set the foundation for what we now call “Modern Physics”.

One of the most straightforward ways to estimate if a model makes sense is to ask whether it predicts the correct order of magnitude for a quantity. Usually, the order of magnitude for a quantity can be determined by making a very simple model, ideally one that you can work through in your head. When we say that a prediction gives the right “order of magnitude”, we usually mean that the prediction is within a factor of “a few” (up to a factor of 10) of the correct answer. For example, if a measurement gives a value of 2000, then we would consider that a model prediction of 8000 gave the right order of magnitude (it differs from the correct answer by a factor of 4), whereas a prediction of 24000 would not (it differs by a factor of 12).\n\nExample 2.1\n\nHow many ping pong balls can you fit into a school bus?

We can model a ping pong ball as a sphere with a diameter of 0.03 {\\rm m} (3 {\\rm cm}). When stacking the ping pong balls, we can model them as little cubes with a side given by their diameter, so the volume of a ping pong ball, for stacking, is \\sim 0.00003 {\\rm m^3}=3\\times 10^{-5} {\\rm m^3}. If we divide 100 {\\rm m^3} by 3\\times 10^{-5} {\\rm m^3}, using scientific notation:\\frac{100 {\\rm m^3}}{3\\times 10^{-5} {\\rm m^3}}=\\frac{{1\\times 10^{2}}}{{3\\times 10^{-5}}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\times 10^7\\sim 3\\times 10^6\n\nThus, we expect to be able to fit about three million ping pong balls in a school bus.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:A school bus and ping pong balls modelled as boxes.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nFill in the following table, giving the order of magnitude (in meters) of the sizes of different physical objects.

This allows us to use a well-defined convention for which units to use when describing quantities. For example, the SI unit for the dimension of length is the meter and the SI unit for the dimension of time is the second.\n\nIn order to simplify the SI unit system, a fundamental (base) set of dimensions was chosen and the SI units were defined for those dimensions.

A few simple rules allow us to easily work out the dimensions of a derived quantity. Suppose that we have two quantities, X and Y, both with dimensions. We then have the following rules to find the dimension of a quantity that depends on X and Y:\n\nAddition/Subtraction: You can only add or subtract two quantities if they have the same dimension: [X+Y]=[X]=[Y]\n\nMultiplication: The dimension of the product, [XY] , is the product of the dimensions: [XY]=[X]\\cdot[Y]\n\nDivision: The dimension of the ratio, [X/Y], is the ratio of the dimensions: [X/Y]=[X]/[Y]\n\nThe next two examples show how to apply dimensional analysis to obtain the unit or dimension of a derived quantity.\n\nExample 2.2\n\nAcceleration has SI units of {\\rm ms^{-2}} and force has the dimension of mass multiplied by acceleration. What are the dimensions and SI units of force, expressed in terms of the base dimensions and units?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can start by expressing the dimension of acceleration, since we know from its SI units that it must have the dimension of length over time squared.[{\\rm acceleration}] = \\frac{L}{T^2}\n\nSince force has the dimension of mass times acceleration, we have:[{\\rm force}] = [{\\rm mass}]\\cdot[{\\rm acceleration}] = M \\frac{L}{T^2}\n\nand the SI units of force are thus:{\\rm SI[force]} = {\\rm kg}\\cdot{\\rm m/s^2}\n\nForce is such a common dimension that it, like many other derived dimensions, has its own derived SI unit, the Newton [N].\n\nExample 2.3\n\nUse \n\nTable 4 to show that voltage has the same dimension as force multiplied by speed and divided by electric current.\n\nSolution\n\nAccording to \n\nTable 4, voltage has the dimension:{\\rm [voltage]=M\\cdot L^2 \\cdot T^{-3}\\cdot I^{-1}}\n\nwhile force, speed and current have dimensions:{\\rm [force]}&={\\rm M\\cdot L\\cdot T^{-2}} \\\\\n{\\rm [speed]}&={\\rm L\\cdot T^{-1}}\\\\\n{\\rm [current]}&={\\rm I}\n\nThe dimension of force multiplied by speed divided by electric charge\\left[\\frac{\\rm force\\cdot speed}{\\rm current}\\right]&=\\frac{\\rm [force]\\cdot [speed]}{\\rm [current]}=\\frac{\\rm M\\cdot L\\cdot T^{-2} \\cdot L\\cdot T^{-1} }{\\rm I}\\\\\n&={\\rm M\\cdot L^2 \\cdot T^{-3}\\cdot I^{-1}}\n\nwhere, in the last line, we combined the powers of the same dimensions. By inspection, this is the same dimension as voltage.\n\nWhen you build a model to predict the value of a physical quantity, you should always use dimensional analysis to ensure that the dimension of the quantity your model predicts is correct.\n\nExample 2.4\n\nYour model predicts that the speed, v, of an object of mass m, after having fallen a distance h on the surface of a planet with mass M and radius R is given by:v = \\frac{mMh}{R}\n\nIs this a reasonable prediction?\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we can see that the speed will be larger if h is bigger, which makes sense, since we expect the speed to be greater if the object fell a greater distance. Similarly, we expect that the speed would be higher if the mass of the planet, M, is larger, as it would exert a larger gravitational force, as given by this model. We also expect that the object will have a greater speed if it has a larger mass, m, if the drag from the atmosphere on the planet is significant. Finally, if the radius of the planet R is larger, we would expect the speed to be smaller, as the planet would be less dense and exert less gravitational force at its surface. However, if we verify the dimensions for the prediction of v, we find the model does not predict dimensions of speed:[v] &= \\frac{[m][M][h]}{[R]}\\\\\n&=\\frac{MML}{L}=M^2\n\nand our model predicts a speed with dimensions of mass squared. By performing simple dimensional analysis, we can easily confirm that our model is definitely wrong. You should always check the dimensions of any model prediction, to make sure it is correct.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nIn this section, we were given three rules for combining dimensions. You’ll notice that these rules are the same as the rules for algebra, except you’re using dimensions instead of x’s and y’s. So, you can really just approach dimensional analysis problems as you would algebra problems.\n\nThere are some basic steps you can follow when you are trying to find the SI units for a value/variable in your equation. I’ll go through \n\nExample 2.2 in a bit of a different way. Let’s say that you have the equation F=ma and this time, you know the dimensions of F and m, and you want to find the dimensions of a:\n\nRewrite the values/variables in your equation in terms of their dimensions, leaving all other operations (multiplication, exponents, etc.) as is: F=m\\cdot a\\rightarrow [F]=[m]\\cdot[a]\n\nRearrange for your unknown dimension: [a]=\\frac{[F]}{[m]}\n\nSubstitute in your known dimensions: [a]=\\frac{[F]}{[m]} \\rightarrow [a]=\\frac{MLT^{-2}}{M}=\\frac{ML}{MT^2}\n\nSolve using the rules of algebra: [a]=\\frac{L}{T^2} (where we just cancelled out the M’s)\n\nReplace the dimensions with their corresponding SI units: [a]=\\frac{L}{T^2}\\rightarrow SI[a]=\\frac{m}{s^2}\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIn Chloe’s theory of falling objects from \n\nOverview, the time, t, for an object to fall a distance, x, was given by t=k\\sqrt{x}. What must the SI units of Chloe’s constant, k, be?}\n\n{\\rm T.L^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\n{\\rm T.L^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\n{\\rm s.m^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\n{\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nDimensional analysis can also be used to determine formulas (usually to within an order of magnitude). One famous example of this is when a British physicist named G.I. Taylor was able to determine a formula that showed how the blast radius of an atomic bomb scaled with time. Using pictures of the first atomic bomb explosion, he was able to determine the amount of energy released in the explosion, which was classified information at the time.\n\nExample 2.5\n\nFind a formula that shows how the blast radius, r, scales with the time since the explosion, t, where the radius also depends on the energy released in the explosion, E, and the density of the medium into which the bomb explodes, ρ.\n\nSolution\n\nWe want to find out how the blast radius scales with time, so we want an expression that relates r to some combination of E, ρ, and t:r \\sim E^x\\rho^y t^z\n\nwhere x, y, and z are our unknown exponents, since we don’t know yet how we will combine E, ρ, and t. However, we do know that when we combine these quantities, we have to get the correct dimension (length) for the radius:[r]=[E]^x[\\rho]^y[t]^z\n\nWe know the dimensions for radius and time, and the dimension for E can be found in Table \\ref{tab:modelandexperiment:derivedSIunits}. Density is mass divided by volume, so its dimension is M/L^3. Our equation then becomes:L&=(ML^2T^{-2})^x(ML^{-3})^y(T)^z\\\\\nL&=(M^xL^{2x}T^{-2x})(M^yL^{-3y})(T^z)\\\\\n\nWe have three unknowns, so we need three equations. We can recognize that the left hand side (with dimension of length, L) is equivalent to L^1\\cdot M^0\\cdot T^0. We can then separate the above expression into three equations, one for each of M, L, and T:M^0&=M^xM^y \\rightarrow 0 = x+y\\\\\nL^1&=L^{2x}L^{-3y} \\rightarrow 1=2x-3y\\\\\nT^0&=T^{-2x}T^{z} \\rightarrow 0=z-2x\n\nSolving the sytem of equations, we find that x=1/5, y=-1/5, and z=2/5.\nSo, the combination of E, ρ, and t that gives us the dimension of length is:r\\propto E^{1/5}\\rho^{-1/5}t^{2/5}\\\\\n\\therefore r\\propto t^{2/5}\n\nYou can also write this equation as:r\\propto \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{Et^2}{\\rho}}\\\\\n\nThus, by measuring the blast radius at some time, and knowing the density of the air, you can estimate the energy that was released during the explosion.","type":"content","url":"/modelandexperiment#dimensional-analysis","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl2":"Making measurements"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/modelandexperiment#making-measurements","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl2":"Making measurements"},"content":"Having introduced some tools for the modelling aspect of physics, we now address the other side of physics, namely performing experiments.

The theory assumes that Chloe’s constant, k, is the same for any object falling any distance on the surface of the Earth.\n\nOne possible way to test Chloe’s theory of falling objects is to measure k for different drop heights to see if we always obtain the same value. Results of such an experiment are presented in Table \\ref{tab:modelandexperiment:kmes}, where the time, t, was measured for a bowling ball to fall distances of x between 1 {\\rm m} and 5 {\\rm m}.

However, we would be incorrect in doing so unless we understood the precision of the measurements that we made. Suppose that we repeated the measurement multiple times at a fixed drop height of x=3 {\\rm m}, and obtained the values in \n\nTable 6.\n\nTable 6:Repeated measurements of the drop time, t, for a bowling ball to fall a distance x=3 {\\rm m}.

Note that we use the word error as a synonym for uncertainty, not ``mistake”. When we present a number with an uncertainty, we mean that we are “pretty certain” that the true value is in the range that we quote.

The value of 68% comes from statistics and the normal distribution.\n\nEmma’s Thoughts\n\n“Precision”, “Accuracy” and “Uncertainty” - what’s the difference?\n\nHave you ever started writing a lab report and wondered whether or not you should describe your measurement in terms of “accuracy” or “precision”? What about describing the error in your experiment as a measure of “accuracy” or “uncertainty”?\n\nYou’re not alone! Precision, accuracy and uncertainty all relate to error, but have different meanings. To clarify these terms, I think it is useful to study them side-by-side.\n\nPrecision refers to how close your measurements are to each other when you repeat a measurement multiple times. If the values obtained are close to one another, your measurements are precise. For example, say you were measuring the rebound height of a basketball, dropped from a fixed height. After performing the measurement multiple times, you find that the measured rebound heights are very close in value to each other. You could then report that “After repeating our measurement multiple times, the values that we obtained were very close together. Our measurements were precise!”. Of course, you have to specify what you mean by “close” (perhaps in terms of the divisions on the ruler that you used to measure rebound height).\n\nAccuracy measures the agreement between a measured value and its true value. If the measured value is close to the true value, your measured value is accurate. For example, say that you developed a model for the distance covered by a rock thrown with a slingshot. If you find that the measured value is close to the predicted value, you would say that your model is accurate, “Our model value was very close to the value that we measured - our model was accurate.” Again, you have to specify what you mean by “close”, usually in terms of the uncertainty on your measured value.\n\nUncertainty is an estimate of the amount that a measurement will differ from a true value. In science, we aim to lower the uncertainty in our measurements, so that we can test models and theories with more precision. Let’s say that you are measuring the number of rotations of a spinning top during a certain period of time. Your measurements are close together, but have a fixed range of values. This would be an example where you could calculate the uncertainty in your measurements. It would be sensible to say “After multiple measurements, we’ve found that our values are similar and our uncertainty captures the range of values that we measured.”","type":"content","url":"/modelandexperiment#sec-modelandexperiment-uncertainties","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl3":"Determining the central value and uncertainty","lvl2":"Making measurements"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/modelandexperiment#sec-modelandexperiment-determiningu","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl3":"Determining the central value and uncertainty","lvl2":"Making measurements"},"content":"The tricky part when performing a measurement is to decide how to assign a central value and an uncertainty. For example, how did we come up with t=0.76 \\pm 0.15 {\\rm s} from the values in \n\nTable 6?\n\nDetermining the uncertainty and central value on a measurement is greatly simplified when one can repeat the same measurement multiple times, as we did in \n\nTable 6. With repeatable measurements, a reasonable choice for the central value and uncertainty is to use the mean and standard deviation of the measurements, respectively.\n\nIf we have N measurements of some quantity t, \\{t_1, t_2, t_3, \\dots t_N\\}, then the mean, \\bar t, and standard deviation, \\sigma_t, are defined as:\\bar t &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} t_i=\\frac{t_1 +t_2 +t_3 +\\dots+ t_N}{N} \\\\\n\\sigma_t^2 &=\\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}(t_i-\\bar t)^2 = \\frac{(t_1-\\bar t)^2+(t_2-\\bar t)^2+(t_3-\\bar t)^2+\\dots+(t_N-\\bar t)^2}{N-1} \\\\\n\\sigma_t &=\\sqrt{\\sigma_t^2}\n\nThe mean is just the arithmetic average of the values, and the standard deviation, \\sigma_t, requires one to first calculate the mean, then the variance (\\sigma^2_t, the square of the standard deviation). You should also note that for the variance, we divide by N-1 instead of N. The standard deviation and variance are quantities that come from statistics and are a good measure of how spread out the values of t are about their mean, and are thus a good measure of the uncertainty.\n\nExample 2.6\n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of the values for k from \n\nTable 6.\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to calculate the standard deviation, we first need to calculate the mean of the N=5 values of k: \\{0.58, 0.44, 0.37, 0.42, 0.38 \\}. The mean is given by:\\bar k = \\frac{0.58 + 0.44 + 0.37 + 0.42 + 0.38}{5} = 0.44{\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nWe can now calculate the variance using the mean:\\sigma^2_k &= \\frac{1}{4}[(0.58-0.44)^2+(0.44-0.44)^2\\\\\n         &+(0.37-0.44)^2+(0.42-0.44)^2+(0.38-0.44)^2]=7.3e-3 {\\rm s^2.m}\n\nand the standard deviation is then given by the square root of the variance:\\sigma_k=\\sqrt{0.0073}=0.09{\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nUsing the mean and standard deviation, we would quote our value of k as :k=0.44 \\pm 0.09{\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nAny value that we measure will always have an uncertainty. In the case where we can easily repeat the measurement, we should do so to evaluate how reproducible it is, and the standard deviation of those values is usually a good first estimate of the uncertainty in a value. Sometimes, the measurements cannot easily be reproduced; in that case, it is still important to determine a reasonable uncertainty, but in this case, it usually has to be estimated.  \n\nTable 7 shows a few common types of measurements and how to determine the uncertainties in those measurements.\n\nTable 7:Different types of measurements and how to assign central values uncertainties.\n\nType of measurement\n\nHow to determine central value and uncertainty\n\nRepeated measurements\n\nMean and standard deviation\n\nSingle measurement with a graduated scale (e.g. ruler, digital scale, analogue meter)\n\nClosest value and half of the smallest division\n\nCounted quantity\n\nCounted value and square root of the value\n\n\n\nFigure 2:The length of the grey rectangle would be quoted as L=2.8\\pm0.05 {\\rm cm} using the rule of “half the smallest division”.\n\nFor example, we would quote the length of the grey object in \n\nFigure 2 to be L=2.8\\pm0.05 {\\rm cm} based on the rules in \n\nTable 7, since 2.8 {\\rm cm} is the closest value on the ruler that matches the length of the object and 0.5 {\\rm mm} is half of the smallest division on the ruler. Using half of the smallest division of the ruler means that our uncertainty range covers one full division. Note that it is usually better to reproduce a measurement to evaluate the uncertainty instead of using half of the smallest division, although half of the smallest division should be the lower limit on the uncertainty. That is, by repeating the measurements and obtaining the standard deviation, you should see if the uncertainty is larger than half of the of the smallest division, not smaller.\n\nThe relative uncertainty in a measured value is given by dividing the uncertainty by the central value, and expressing the result as a percent. For example, the relative uncertainty in t=0.76\\pm 0.15 {\\rm s} is given by 0.15/0.76=20\\%. The relative uncertainty gives an idea of how precisely a value was determined. Typically, a value above 10% means that it was not a very precise measurement, and we would generally consider a value smaller than 1% to correspond to quite a precise measurement.","type":"content","url":"/modelandexperiment#sec-modelandexperiment-determiningu","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl4":"Random and systematic sources of error/uncertainty","lvl3":"Determining the central value and uncertainty","lvl2":"Making measurements"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/modelandexperiment#random-and-systematic-sources-of-error-uncertainty","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl4":"Random and systematic sources of error/uncertainty","lvl3":"Determining the central value and uncertainty","lvl2":"Making measurements"},"content":"It is important to note that there are two possible sources of uncertainty in a measurement. The first is called “statistical” or “random” and occurs because it is impossible to exactly reproduce a measurement. For example, every time you lay down a ruler to measure something, you might shift it slightly one way or the other which will affect your measurement. The important property of random sources of uncertainty is that if you reproduce the measurement many times, these will tend to cancel out and the mean can usually be determined to high precision with enough measurements.\n\nThe other source of uncertainty is called “systematic”. Systematic uncertainties are much more difficult to detect and to estimate. One example would be trying to measure something with a scale that was not properly tarred (where the 0 weight was not set). You may end up with very small random errors when measuring the weights of object (very repeatable measurements), but you would have a hard time noticing that all of your weights were offset by a certain amount unless you had access to a second scale. Some common examples of systematic uncertainties are: incorrectly calibrated equipment, parallax error when measuring distance, reaction times when measuring time, effects of temperature on materials, etc.\n\nAs a reminder, we want to emphasize the difference between “error” and “mistake” in the context of making measurements. “Uncertainty” or “error” in a measurement comes from the fact that it is impossible to measure anything to infinite accuracy. A “mistake” also affects a measurement, but is preventable. If a “mistake” occurs in physics, the experiment is generally re-done and the previous data are discarded. The term “human error” should never be used in a lab report as it implies that a mistake was made. Instead, if you think that you measured time imprecisely, for example, refer to “human reaction time”, not “human error”.\n\nTable 8 shows examples of sources of error that students often call “human error” but that should, instead, be described more precisely.\n\nTable 8:Don’t use the term “human error”, instead, use these.\n\nSituation\n\nSource of Error\n\nWhile taking measurements, your line of sight was not completely parallel to the measuring device.\n\nThis is parallax error - a type of systematic error.\n\nYou incorrectly performed calculations.\n\nMistake!

We also calculated a value of k corresponding to each value of t, and found k=0.44 \\pm 0.09{\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} (\n\nExample 2.6).\n\nSuppose that we did not have access to the individual values of t, but only to the value of t=0.76 \\pm 0.15 {\\rm s} with uncertainty. How do we calculate a value for k with uncertainty? In order to answer this question, we need to know how to “propagate” the uncertainties in a measured value to the uncertainty in a value derived the measured value. We briefly present different methods for propagating uncertainties, before advocating for the use of computers to do the calculations for you.\n\nEstimate using relative uncertainties The relative uncertainty in a measurement gives us an idea of how precisely a value was determined. Any quantity that depends on that measurement should have a precision that is similar; that is, we expect the relative uncertainty in k to be similar to that in t. For t, we saw that the relative uncertainty was approximately 20%. If we take the central value of k to be the central value of t divided by \\sqrt x, we find:k=\\frac{(0.76 {\\rm s})}{\\sqrt{(3 {\\rm m})}}=0.44{\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nSince we expect the relative uncertainty in k to be approximately 20%, then the absolute uncertainty is given by:\\sigma_k = (0.2) k=0.09 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nwhich is close to the value obtained by averaging the five values of k in \n\nTable 6.\n\nThe Min-Max method A pedagogical way to determine k and its uncertainty is to use the “Min-Max method”. Since k=t/\\sqrt x, k will be the biggest when t is the biggest, and the smallest when t is the smallest. We can thus determine “minimum” and “maximum” values of k corresponding to the minimum value of t, t^{min}=0.61 {\\rm s} and the maximum value of t, t^{max}=0.91 {\\rm s}:k^{min} &= \\frac{t^{min}}{\\sqrt x}=\\frac{0.61\\,s}{\\sqrt{(3\\,m)}} = 0.35 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\\\\nk^{max} &= \\frac{t^{max}}{\\sqrt x}=\\frac{0.91\\,s}{\\sqrt{(3\\,m)}} = 0.53{\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\\\\n\nThis gives us the range of values of k that correspond to the range of values of t. We can choose the middle of the range as the central value of k and half of the range as the uncertainty:\\bar k &= \\frac{1}{2}(k^{min}+k^{max})= 0.44 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\\\\n\\sigma_k &= \\frac{1}{2}(k^{max}-k^{min})= 0.09 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\\\\n\\therefore k&= 0.44 \\pm 0.09 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nwhich, in this case, gives the same value as that obtained by averaging the individual values of k. While the Min-Max method is useful for illustrating the concept of propagating uncertainties, we usually do not use it in practice as it tends to overestimate the uncertainty.\n\nThe derivative method In the example above, we assumed that the value of x was known precisely (and we chose 3,m), which of course is not realistic. Let us suppose that we have measured x to within 1 {\\rm cm} so that x=3.00 \\pm 0.01 {\\rm m}. The task is now to calculate k=\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{x}} when both x and t have uncertainties.\n\nThe derivative method lets us propagate the uncertainty in a general way, so long as the relative uncertainties on all quantities are “small” (less than 10-20%). If we have a function, F(x,y) that depends on multiple variables with uncertainties (e.g. x\\pm\\sigma_x, y\\pm\\sigma_y), then the central value and uncertainty in F(x,y) are given by:\\bar F &= F(\\bar x, \\bar y) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\sigma_F &= \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dF}{dx}\\sigma_x \\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dF}{dy}\\sigma_y \\right)^2 }\n\nThat is, the central value of the function F is found by evaluating the function at the central values of x and y. The uncertainty in F, \\sigma_F, is found by taking the quadrature sum of the partial derivatives of F evaluated at the central values of x and y multiplied by the uncertainties in the corresponding variables that F depends on. The uncertainty will contain one term in the sum per variable that F depends on.\n\nIn \n\nAppendix D, we will show you how to calculate this easily with a computer, so do not worry about getting comfortable with partial derivatives (yet!). Note that the partial derivative, \\frac{dF}{dx}, is simply the derivative of F(x,y) relative to x evaluated as if y were a constant. Also, when we say “add in quadrature”, we mean square the quantities, add them, and then take the square root (same as you would do to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle).\n\nExample 2.7\n\nUse the derivative method to evaluate k=\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{x}} for x=3.00 \\pm 0.01 {\\rm m} and t=0.76\\pm0.15 {\\rm s}.\n\nSolution\n\nHere, k=k(x,t) is a function of both x and t. The central value is easily found using the central values for x and t:\\bar k = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{x}} = \\frac{(0.76 {\\rm s})}{\\sqrt{(3 {\\rm m})}}= 0.44 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nNext, we need to determine and evaluate the partial derivative of k with respect to t and x:\\frac{dk}{dt}&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\frac{d}{dt}t=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(3 {\\rm m})}}=0.58 {\\rm m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\\\\\n\\frac{dk}{dx}&=t\\frac{d}{dx}x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}=-\\frac{1}{2}tx^{-\\frac{3}{2}}= -\\frac{1}{2}(0.76 {\\rm s})(3.00 {\\rm m})^{-\\frac{3}{2}}=-0.073 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{3}{2}}}\n\nAnd finally, we plug this into the quadrature sum to get the uncertainty in k:\\\\sigma_k&=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dk}{dx}\\sigma_x \\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dk}{dt}\\sigma_t \\right)^2 }\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\left((0.073 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{3}{2}}}) (0.01 {\\rm m}) \\right)^2 + \\left((0.58 {\\rm m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}})(0.15 {\\rm s}) \\right)^2 } \\\\\n&=0.09 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nSo we find that:k&= 0.44 \\pm 0.09 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\nwhich is consistent with what we found with the other two methods.\n\nDiscussion: We should ask ourselves if the value we found is reasonable, since we also included an uncertainty in x and would expect a bigger uncertainty than in the previous calculations where we only had an uncertainty in t. The reason that the uncertainty in k has remained the same is that the relative uncertainty in x is very small, \\frac{0.01}{3.00}\\sim 0.3\\%, so it contributes very little compared to the 20% uncertainty from t.\n\nThe derivative method leads to a few simple short cuts when propagating the uncertainties for simple operations, as shown in \n\nTable 10.

From these data, we would conclude that our measurements are consistent with Chloe’s Theory. Again, remember that we can never confirm a theory, we can only exclude it; in this case, we cannot exclude Chloe’s Theory with these data.

We thus need a precise and consistent way to compare measurements with each other and with predictions. Suppose that we have measured a value for Chloe’s constant k= 0.44 \\pm 0.09 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}. Of course, Chloe’s theory does not predict a value for k, only that fall time is proportional to the square root of the distance fallen. Isaac Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity does predict a value for k of $0.45 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} with negligible uncertainty. In this case, since the model (theoretical) value easily falls within the range given by our uncertainty, we would say that our measurement is consistent (or compatible) with the theoretical prediction.\n\nSuppose that, instead, we had measured k=0.55 \\pm 0.08 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} so that the lowest value compatible with our measurement, k=0.55 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}-0.08 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}= 0.47 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}, is not compatible with Newton’s prediction. Would we conclude that our measurement invalidates Newton’s theory? The answer is: it depends... What “it depends on” should always be discussed any time that you present a measurement (even if your measurement is compatible with a prediction - maybe that was a fluke). Below, we list a few common points that should be addressed when presenting a measurement that will guide you into deciding whether your measurement is consistent with a prediction:\n\nHow was the uncertainty determined and/or propagated? Was this reasonable?\n\nAre there systematic effects that were not taken into account when determining the uncertainty? (e.g. reaction time, parallax, something difficult to reproduce).\n\nAre the relative uncertainties reasonable based on the precision that you would reasonably expect?\n\nWhat assumptions were made in calculating your measured value?\n\nWhat assumptions were made in determining the model prediction?\n\nIn the above, our value of k= 0.55 \\pm 0.08 {\\rm s.m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}} is the result of propagating the uncertainty in t. It is thus conceivable that the true value of t, and therefore of k, is outside the range that we determined. Since our value of k is still quite close to the predicted value, we would not claim to have invalidated Newton’s theory with this measurement. The difference between our measurement and the predicted value is only 1.25 times \\sigma_k, so very close to the value of the uncertainty.\n\nIn a similar way, we can discuss whether two different measurements, each with an uncertainty, are compatible with each other. If the ranges given by uncertainties in two values overlap, then they are clearly compatible. If, on the other hand, the ranges do not overlap, they could be inconsistent or the discrepancy might instead be the result of how the uncertainties were determined and the measurements could still be considered consistent with each other.","type":"content","url":"/modelandexperiment#comparing-model-and-measurement-discussing-a-result","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/modelandexperiment#summary","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2 - Comparing Model and Experiment","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"Measurable quantities have dimensions and units.

Chelsea’s closet is a ``walk-in closet’ with two double doors. If we know the dimensions of the door, we can estimate the width and height of the closet. Estimating the average size of a large door to be 1 {\\rm m}\\times 2 {\\rm m}, one face of the close will have an area of 4 {\\rm m^2}.

For example, we may wish to describe the location of a train along a straight section of track that runs in the East-West direction. In order to do so, we must first define an “origin”, which is the reference point of our coordinate system. For example, the origin for our train track may be the Kingston train station (\n\nFigure 1).\n\nWe can describe the position of the train by specifying how far it is from the train station (the origin), using a single real number, say x. If the train is at position x=0, then we know that it is at the Kingston station. If the object is not at the origin, then we need to be able to specify on which side (East or West in our train example) of the origin the object is located. We do this by choosing a direction for our one dimensional coordinate x. For example, we may choose that the East side of the track corresponds to positive values of x and that the West side of the track correspond to the negative values of x. Thus, in order to fully specify a one-dimensional coordinate system we need to choose:\n\nthe location of the origin.\n\nthe direction in which the coordinate, x, increases.\n\nthe units in which we wish to express x.\n\nIn one dimension, it is common to use the variable x to define the position along the “x-axis”.

The easiest way to do this is to define two axes, x and y, whose origin and direction we must define. \n\nFigure 2 shows an example of such a coordinate system. Although it is not necessary to do so, we chose x and y axes that are perpendicular to each other. The origin of the coordinate system is where the two axes intersect. One is free to choose any two directions for the axes (as long as they are not parallel). However, choosing axes that are perpendicular (a “Cartesian” coordinate system) is usually the most convenient.\n\nTo fully describe the position of an object, we must specify both its position along the x and y axes. For example, point P in \n\nFigure 2 has two coordinates, x_p and y_p, that define its position. The x coordinate is found by drawing a line through P that is parallel to the y axis and is given by the intersection of that line with the x axis. The y coordinate is found by drawing a line through point P that is parallel to the x axis and is given by the intersection of that line with the y axis.\n\nCheckpoint 3.1\n\nFigure 3 shows a coordinate system that is not orthogonal (where the x and y axes are not perpendicular).

When applicable, by convention, we usually choose the y axis to correspond to the vertical direction.\n\nAnother common choice is a “polar” coordinate system, where the position of an object is specified by a distance to the origin, r, and an angle, θ, relative to a specified direction, as shown in \n\nFigure 4. Often, a polar coordinate system is defined alongside a Cartesian system, so that r is the distance to the origin of the Cartesian system and θ is the angle with respect to the x axis.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Example of a polar coordinate system and a point P with coordinates (r,\\theta).\n\nOne can easily convert between the two Cartesian coordinates, x and y, and the two corresponding polar coordinates, r and θ:\\begin{align*}\nx&=r\\cos(\\theta)\\\\\ny&=r\\sin(\\theta)\\\\\nr&=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\\\\n\\tan(\\theta) &= \\frac{y}{x}\n\\end{align*}\n\nPolar coordinates are often used to describe the motion of an object moving around a circle, as this means that only one of the coordinates (θ) changes with time (if the origin of the coordinate system is chosen to coincide with the centre of the circle).","type":"content","url":"/vectors#id-2d-coordinate-systems","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"3D Coordinate systems","lvl2":"Coordinate systems"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/vectors#id-3d-coordinate-systems","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"3D Coordinate systems","lvl2":"Coordinate systems"},"content":"In three dimensions, we need to specify three numbers to describe the position of an object (e.g. a bird flying in the air). In a three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, we simply add a third axis, z, that is mutually perpendicular to both x and y. The position of an object can then be specified by using the three coordinates, x, y, and z. By convention, we use the z axis to be the vertical direction in three dimensions.\n\nTwo additional coordinate systems are common in three dimensions: “cylindrical” and “spherical” coordinates. All three systems are illustrated in \n\nFigure 5 superimposed onto the Cartesian system.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Cartesian (left), cylindrical (centre) and spherical (right) coordinate systems used in three dimensions. The y and z axes are in the plane of the page, whereas the x axis comes out of the page.\n\nCylindrical coordinates can be thought of as an extension of the polar coordinates. We keep the same Cartesian coordinate z to indicate the height above the xy plane, however, we use the azimuthal angle, ϕ, and the radius, ρ, to describe the position of the projection of a point onto the xy plane. ϕ is the angle between the x axis and the line from the origin to the projection of the point in the xy plane and ρ is the distance between the point and the z axis. Thus, cylindrical coordinates are very similar to the polar coordinate system introduced in two dimensions, except with the addition of the z coordinate. Cylindrical coordinates are useful for describing situations with azimuthal symmetry, such as the motion along the surface of a cylinder. For example, consider point P in \n\nFigure 6. Point P is located a distance ρ from the z axis, as it is located on the surface of the cylinder (the circular end of the cylinder has a radius ρ). Point P is a height z above the xy plane, and a line from the z axis to point P makes an angle ϕ with the x axis.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Describing the position of P, located on the surface of a cylinder, in cylindrical coordinates.\n\nThe cylindrical coordinates are related to the Cartesian coordinates by:\\begin{align*}\n\\rho &= \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\\\\n\\tan(\\phi) &= \\frac{y}{x}\\\\\nz&=z\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn spherical coordinates, a point P is described by the radius, r, the polar angle θ, and the azimuthal angle, ϕ. The radius is the distance between the point and the origin. The polar angle is the angle with the z axis that is made by the line from the origin to the point. The azimuthal angle is defined in the same way as in polar coordinates. Note that the value of ϕ must be between 0 and 2\\pi, whereas the value of θ must be between 0 and π.\n\nSpherical coordinates are useful for describing situations that have spherical symmetry, such as a person walking on the surface of the Earth, since the radial coordinate will not change.

In this section, we introduce the notion of a “vector”, which allows us to describe quantities that have a magnitude and a direction. For example, you can use a vector to describe the fact that you walked \\SI{5}{km} in the North direction. A vector can be visualized by an arrow. The length of the arrow is the magnitude that we wish to describe, and the direction of the arrow corresponds to the direction that we would like to describe.\n\nUnlike a point in space, vectors have no location. That is, vectors are simply an arrow, and you can choose to draw that arrow anywhere you like. In two dimensional space, one requires two numbers to completely define a vector. In three dimensional space, one requires three numbers to completely define a vector. \n\nFigure 8 shows a two dimensional vector, \\vec d, twice. Because both arrows in the figure have the same magnitude and direction, they represent the same vector. When we refer to quantities that are vectors, we usually draw an arrow on top of the quantity (\\vec d) to indicate that they are vectors. We use the word “scalar” to refer to numbers that are not vectors (a regular number is thus also called a scalar to distinguish it from a quantity that is a vector).\n\n\n\nFigure 8:A vector \\vec d shown twice, once with its Cartesian components (d_x, d_y) and once with its magnitude and direction (d, ϕ).\n\nIn analogy with coordinate systems, we have multiple ways to choose the numbers that we use to describe the vector. The most convenient choice is usually to use the “Cartesian components” of the vector which correspond to the length of the vector when projected onto a Cartesian coordinate system. For example, in \n\nFigure 8, the Cartesian components of the vector \\vec d are labelled as (d_x, d_y) indicating that the vector has a length of d_x in the x direction and d_y in the y direction. Furthermore, the number d_x is negative, since the vector points in the negative x direction. Another common choice is to use the length of the vector, which we label d (the name of the vector without the arrow on top), and the angle, ϕ that the vector makes with the x-axis, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 8. In terms of the two dimensional Cartesian components, the magnitude of the vector is given by:\\begin{align*}\nd&= ||\\vec d||= \\sqrt{d_x^2+d_y^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we also introduced the notation that placing two vertical bars around a vector (||\\vec d||) is used to indicated its magnitude.

If the vector is coming out of the page (at you!), then you would see the head of the arrow, which we represent as a circle with a dot (the dot is the point of the arrow, the circle is the base of the conically shaped arrowhead). If instead, the vector points into the page, then you would see the back of the arrow, which we represent as a cross (the cross being the feathers in the tail of the arrow).

The cross product of those two vectors will give a third vector that is perpendicular to the plane (making it perpendicular to both vectors).\n\nAlgebraically, the three components of the vector product, \\vec a\\times \\vec b, of vectors \\vec a and \\vec b are found as follows:\\vec a \\times \\vec b =\\begin{pmatrix}\n           a_yb_z - a_z b_y\\\\\n           a_zb_x - a_x b_z\\\\\n           a_xb_y - a_y b_x\\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}\n\nOne important property to note is that \\vec a \\times \\vec b = -\\vec b \\times \\vec a; that is, the cross product is not commutative (the order matters). The magnitude of the vector obtained by a cross product is given by:||\\vec a \\times \\vec b ||=ab\\sin\\theta\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors \\vec a and \\vec b when these are placed tail to tail (\n\nFigure 12). The vector resulting from a cross product will be null (have a zero length) if the vectors \\vec a and \\vec b are parallel, and will have a maximal length when these are perpendicular. The cross product is useful to determine quantities that are maximal when two vectors are perpendicular.\n\nGeometrically, one can determine the direction of the cross product of two vectors by using a “right hand rule”. To distinguish it from another right hand rule (see \n\nSection 3.5.3), we will call it “the right hand rule for the cross product”). This is done by using your right hand, aligning your thumb with the first vector and your index with the second vector. The cross product will point in the direction of your middle finger (when you hold your middle finger perpendicular to the other two fingers). This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 14. Thus, you can often avoid using equation \n\n(18) and instead use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the cross product and equation \n\n(19) to find its magnitude.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Using the right hand rule for cross products to find the direction of the cross product of vectors \\vec a (upwards) and \\vec b (into the page).\n\nThe unit vectors that define a coordinate system have the following properties relative to the cross product:\\begin{align*}\n\\hat x \\times \\hat y &= \\hat z\\\\\n\\hat y \\times \\hat z &= \\hat x\\\\\n\\hat z \\times \\hat x &= \\hat y\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFor these properties to be correct, it should be noted that the direction of the z axis in three dimensions is specified by the choice of x and y axes. That is, one can freely choose the direction of the x and y axes, which then define a plane to which the z axis will be perpendicular. The direction of the z axis must be chosen so that \\hat x \\times \\hat y = \\hat z (this guarantees that the coordinate system is “right handed”), as in \n\nFigure 15.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:Two possible orientations for a three dimensional coordinate system. You can confirm using the right hand rule that the z axis is the cross product \\hat x \\times \\hat y.","type":"content","url":"/vectors#sec-vectors-vectorproduct","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/vectors#example-uses-of-vectors-in-physics","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"content":"This section gives a quick overview of some applications of vectors in physics.","type":"content","url":"/vectors#example-uses-of-vectors-in-physics","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Kinematics and vector equations","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/vectors#kinematics-and-vector-equations","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Kinematics and vector equations","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"content":"Kinematics is the description of the position and motion of an object (Chapters \n\n and \n\n). The laws of physics are the principles that ultimately allow us to determine how the position of an object changes with time. For example, Newton’s Laws are a mathematical framework that introduce the concepts of force and mass in order to model and determine how an object will move through space.\n\nWe often use a position vector, \\vec r(t), to describe the position of an object as a function of time. Because the object can move, the position vector is a function of time. A position vector is a special vector in the sense that it should be considered to be fixed in space; the position vector for an object points from the origin of a coordinate system to the location of the object.\n\nThe three components of the position vector in Cartesian coordinates, are the x, y, and z coordinates of the object:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec r(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n           x(t) \\\\\n           y(t) \\\\\n           z(t) \\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the three coordinates of the object are functions of time if the object can move. Suppose that the object was initially at position \\vec r_1=(x_1, y_1, z_1) at some time t=t_1, and that later, at time t=t_2, the object was at as second position, \\vec r_2=(x_2, y_2, z_2). We can define the displacement vector, \\vec  d, as the vector from position \\vec r_1 to position \\vec r_2:\\begin{align*}\n \\vec d = \\vec r_2 - \\vec r_1 =\\begin{pmatrix}\n           x_2-x_1 \\\\\n           y_2-y_1 \\\\\n           z_2-z_1 \\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n           \\Delta x \\\\\n           \\Delta y \\\\\n           \\Delta z \\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe displacement vector is such that one can add the vector \\vec d to the vector \\vec r_1 to describe the new position of the object at time t_2:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec d &= \\vec r_2 - \\vec r_1\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec r_2 &= \\vec r_1 + \\vec d\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe components of the displacement vector, \\Delta x, \\Delta y, and \\Delta z correspond to the displacements (the distance travelled) along the x, y, and z axes, respectively. This is illustrated for the two dimensional case in \n\nFigure 16.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Illustration of a displacement vector, \\vec d = \\vec r_2 -\\vec r_1, for an object that was located at position \\vec r_1 at time t_1 and at position \\vec r_2 at time t_2.\n\nThe velocity vector of the object, \\vec v=(v_x, v_y, v_z), is defined to be the displacement vector, \\vec d, divided by the amount of time (a scalar) that elapsed, \\Delta t=t_2-t_1, while the object moved by the corresponding displacement:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec v = \\frac{\\vec d}{\\Delta t}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n           \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n           \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n           \\frac{\\Delta z}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe used the property that dividing a vector by a scalar (\\Delta t) is defined as dividing each component by the scalar. If we write the components of the velocity vector out explicitly, we have:\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n           v_x \\\\\n           v_y \\\\\n           v_z \\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n           \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n           \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n           \\frac{\\Delta z}{\\Delta t}\n         \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThat is, we can think of each row in this “vector equation” as an independent equation. That is, when we write the vector equation:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec v = \\frac{\\vec d}{\\Delta t}\n\\end{align*}\n\nwe are really just using a shorthand notation for writing the three independent equations that are true for each individual component of the vectors:\\begin{align*}\nv_x &= \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\\\\nv_y &= \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta t} \\\\\nv_z &= \\frac{\\Delta z}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhenever we write an equation using vectors, we are really writing out multiple equations all at once, one for each component. Newton’s Second Law:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec F = m \\vec a\n\\end{align*}\n\nthus corresponds to the three (scalar) equations:\\begin{align*}\nF_x &= ma_x\\\\\nF_y &= ma_y\\\\\nF_z &= ma_z\\\\\n\\end{align*}","type":"content","url":"/vectors#kinematics-and-vector-equations","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Work and scalar products","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/vectors#work-and-scalar-products","position":32},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Work and scalar products","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"content":"As we will see, “work” is a scalar quantity that allows us to determine the change in the speed (squared) of an object that results from a force exerted over a particular displacement (Chapter \n\nSection 7.1). Both force and the displacement are vector quantities (a force has a magnitude and is exerted in a particular direction). The work, W, done by a force, \\vec F, over a displacements, \\vec d, is defined as:\\begin{align*}\nW = \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe work energy theorem tells us that this work is related to the change in speed squared of the object as it moves along the displacement vector d. If the work is zero, the object has the same speed at the beginning and end of the displacement. If the work is positive, the object is moving faster at the end of the displacement (and slower if the work is negative). A one dimensional example is shown in \n\nFigure 17, which shows a force \\vec F being applied to a block as it slides along the ground over a distance d (represented by the displacement vector \\vec d).\n\n\n\nFigure 17:Example of a force \\vec F being applied on an object as it moves along the displacement vector \\vec d.\n\nIntuitively, it makes sense that only the horizontal component of the force would contribute to changing the speed of the object as it moves along the horizontal trajectory defined by the vector \\vec d. The vertical component of the force does not contribute to changing the speed of the object. Thus, the work (the change in speed), should only depend on the component of the force that is parallel to the displacement vector. The scalar product allows us to formalize this in an equation. The scalar product is given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec F \\cdot \\vec d = Fd\\cos\\theta = F_{\\parallel}d\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we introduced F_{\\parallel} = F\\cos\\theta as the component of \\vec F that is parallel to \\vec d (see \n\nFigure 17). The scalar product thus “picks out” the component of \\vec F that is parallel to \\vec d, which is exactly what we need to in order for work to make sense.","type":"content","url":"/vectors#work-and-scalar-products","position":33},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Using vectors to describe rotational motion","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/vectors#sec-vectors-rotationalmotion","position":34},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Using vectors to describe rotational motion","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"content":"Often, we need to describe rotational motion in physics. If an object is rotating, one must specify:\n\nThe axis about which the object is rotating\n\nThe direction about that axis in which the object is rotating (e.g. clockwise or counter-clockwise)\n\nHow fast the object is rotating\nWe introduce a new type of vector, an “axial vector”, to describe this kind of rotational motion. We choose the direction of the vector to be co-linear with the axis of rotation and the magnitude of the vector to represent the speed with which the object is rotating. We are thus left with two choices for the direction of the vector. For example, consider the wheels on a car that is moving away from you (\n\nFigure 18, the car is moving into the page).  The axis of rotation is the axis of the wheel, so we know that the vector describing the wheel’s rotation (the angular velocity vector) must point either to the left or to the right.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:The wheels on a car that is driving away from you.\n\nWe choose the direction of the vector by using another right hand rule. We will refer to this as “the right hand rule for axial vectors” to distinguish it from the right hand rule for the cross product.  When using the right hand rule for axial vectors, the vector points in the direction of your thumb when you curl your fingers in the direction of rotation, as in \n\nFigure 19. For the car moving away from you, the wheels will be turning such that the closest point to you is moving up and the furthest point is moving down. Using the right hand rule, we find that the rotation vector points to the left.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:Using the right hand rule for axial quantities. In this case, the direction of rotation is counter clockwise when looking at the page (the direction that the fingers curl), so the rotation vector points out of the page (the direction of the thumb).\n\nWe have to distinguish axial vectors from “true” vectors because they do not behave like true vectors in all cases.\nFor instance, imagine that there is a giant mirror that runs parallel to the road (\n\nFigure 20). When the car is reflected in the mirror, the reflected car will also be moving away from you. This means that the wheels will be turning in the same direction as before, so the rotation vector still points to the left. Now consider a true vector, like a velocity vector. If the velocity vector initially pointed to the left (i.e. if the car was moving to the left), the reflected car would be moving to the right. So, we expect a true vector to change directions when it is reflected in this way. Since the rotation vector does not always behave like a true vector, we call it an axial vector or a “pseudovector.”\n\n\n\nFigure 20:Left: The angular velocity vector for the rotation of the wheels, \\vec \\omega, which points to the left, also points left in the reflection. Right: The velocity vector, pointing to the left, points to the right in the reflection of the car. The angular velocity vector is called an “axial” or “pseudo” vector because it does not change direction under a reflection.","type":"content","url":"/vectors#sec-vectors-rotationalmotion","position":35},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Torque and vector products","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/vectors#torque-and-vector-products","position":36},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl3":"Torque and vector products","lvl2":"Example uses of vectors in physics"},"content":"We will introduce the concept of a torque in order to describe how a force can cause an object to rotate.

The position of a point is described by the coordinates of the point (one coordinate per axis). Polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems can be defined relative to a Cartesian coordinate system and sometimes facilitate the description of situations with cylindrical (azimuthal) or spherical symmetry.\n\nVectors can be represented by arrows and are quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction, as opposed to “scalars”, which are simply numbers. Vectors are not fixed in space, so two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction, regardless of where they are drawn. We place a little arrow above a variable, \\vec d, to indicate that it is a vector. There are several, equivalent, notations to indicate the components of a vector:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec d &= (d_x,d_y, d_z)\\quad&\\text{row vector}\\\\\n       &=\\begin{pmatrix}\n           d_x \\\\\n           d_y \\\\\n           d_z\\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}\\quad&\\text{column vector}\\\\\n         &= d_x\\hat x +d_y \\hat y +d_z \\hat z\\quad&\\text{using }\\hat x,\\;\\hat y,\\;\\hat z\\\\\n         &=d_x\\hat i +d_y \\hat j+d_z \\hat k \\quad&\\text{using }\\hat i,\\;\\hat j,\\;\\hat k\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf we multiply (divide) a vector by a scalar, we multiply (divide) each component of the vector individually by that quantity. As a result, the magnitude of the vector will also be multiplied (divided) by that quantity:\\begin{align*}\na\\vec d = \\begin{pmatrix}\n           ad_x \\\\\n           ad_y \\\\\n           ad_z \\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn particular, we can define a unit vector, \\hat d, to be a vector of length 1 in the same direction as \\vec d, by simply dividing \\vec d by its magnitude, d:\\begin{align*}\n\\hat d = \\frac{\\vec d}{d}\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the magnitude of the vector, ||\\vec d|| = d, expressed in Cartesian coordinates, is given by:\\begin{align*}\n||\\vec d|| = d =\\sqrt{d_x^2+d_y^2+d_z^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can add two vectors by independently adding the individual components of the vectors:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec c &= \\vec a + \\vec b\\\\\n\\therefore c_x &= a_x + b_x\\\\\n\\therefore c_y &= a_y + b_y\\\\\n\\therefore c_z &= a_z + b_z\n\\end{align*}\n\nGraphically, this corresponds to adding vectors “head to tail”. This also highlights that an equation written using vectors (as the first line above) really represents three independent equations, one for each coordinate of the vectors (or two in two dimensions). Subtraction of vectors is treated in the same way as addition (but using minus signs where appropriate).\n\nOne can define the scalar (or dot) product between two vectors, as a scalar quantity that is obtained from the two vectors:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b = a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe scalar product is also related to the angle, θ, between the two vectors when these are placed “tail to tail”:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b = ab\\cos\\theta\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn particular, the scalar product between two vectors is zero if the two vectors are perpendicular to each other (\\cos\\theta=0), and maximal when these are parallel to each other.\n\nThe vector (or cross) product between two vectors is a vector that is mutually perpendicular to both vectors and is defined as the following:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec a \\times \\vec b =\\begin{pmatrix}\n           a_yb_z - a_z b_y\\\\\n           a_zb_x - a_x b_z\\\\\n           a_xb_y - a_y b_x\\\\\n         \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe vector product can only be defined in three dimensions, since it must be mutually perpendicular to the vectors. The magnitude of the vector product is given by:\\begin{align*}\n|| \\vec a \\times \\vec b || = ab\\sin\\theta\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the two vectors when these are placed tail to tail. In particular, the vector product between two vectors is zero if the two vectors are parallel to each other (and maximal when these are perpendicular). The direction of the vector product is given by the right-hand rule for the cross product.\n\nAn axial vector can be used to describe a quantity that is related to rotation. The direction of the axial vector is co-linear with the axis of rotation, its magnitude is given by the magnitude of the rotational quantity (e.g. angular speed), and its direction is defined using the right-hand rule for axial vectors.","type":"content","url":"/vectors#summary","position":39},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl2":"Thinking about the Material"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/vectors#thinking-about-the-material","position":40},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3 - Vectors","lvl2":"Thinking about the Material"},"content":"Reflect and research\n\nWhat are some quantities that need to be represented by a vector?\n\nCan a vector in three dimensions be represented using spherical coordinates?

However, relative to the surface of the Sun, your velocity, and momentum, are not zero. As we will see, forces are related to a changes in momentum, just as they are related to a change in velocity (acceleration).\n\nConsider a point particle moving at constant velocity such as a rock sliding across a frozen pond.

We will designate the direction the rock slides as being along the x-axis.\n\n\n\n(a)The initial position x_o=0.5 {\\rm m} of a rock sliding across a frozen pond.\n\n\n\n(b)The position of a rock sliding across a frozen pond as time progresses.\n\nFigure 1:The motion diagram of a rock sliding across a frozen pond.\n\nAs time progresses, the rock will be at greater and greater distances from the shore. As shown in \n\nFigure 1b, the rock slides 0.5 meters every second. Suppose we recorded its x-position every second in a table and obtained the values in \n\nTable 1 (we will ignore measurement uncertainties discussed in \n\nSection 2.4.1 and pretend that the values are exact).\n\nTable 1:Time and x-position of a rock sliding across a frozen pond recorded every second.\n\nTime t (s)\n\nx-position (m)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n2.5\n\n5.0\n\n3.0\n\n6.0\n\n3.5\n\n7.0\n\n4.0\n\n8.0\n\n4.5\n\n9.0\n\n5.0\n\nThe easiest way to visualize the values in the table is to plot them on a graph, as in \n\nFigure 2. Plotting position as a function of time is one of the most common graphs to make in physics, since it is often a complete description of the motion of an object.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Plot of position as a function of time using the values from \n\nTable 1.\n\nThe data plotted in \n\nFigure 2 show that the x position of the ball increases linearly with time (i.e. it is a straight line and the position increases at a constant rate). This means that in equal time increments, the rock will cover equal distances. Note that we also had the liberty to choose when we define t=0; in this case, we chose that time is zero when the rock is at x=0.5 {\\rm m}.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nUsing the data from \n\nTable 1, at what position along the x-axis will the ball be when time is t=9.5 {\\rm s}, if it continues its motion undisturbed?\n\n5.0 {\\rm m}\n\n5.25 {\\rm m}\n\n5.75 {\\rm m}\n\n6.0 {\\rm m}\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nSince the position as a function of time for the ball plotted in \n\nFigure 2 is linear, we can summarize our description of the motion using a function, x(t), instead of having to tabulate the values as we did in Table \n\nTable 1. The function will have the functional form:\\boxed{x(t) = x_0 + v_x t}\n\nThe constant x_0 is the ``offset’’ of the function; the value that the function has at t= 0 {\\rm s}. We call x_0 the “initial position” of the object (its position at t=0). The constant v_x is the “slope” of the function and gives the rate of change of the position as a function of time. We call v_x the “velocity” of the object.\n\nThe initial position is simply the value of the position at t=0, and is given from the table as:x_0 = 0.5 {\\rm m}\n\nThe velocity, v_x, is simply the difference in position, \\Delta x, between any two points divided by the amount of time, \\Delta t, that it took the object to move between those two points (“rise over run” for the graph of x(t)):\\vec v &= \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\hat x\\rightarrow \\frac{dx}{dt} \\hat x\\\\\n\\vec v &= \\frac{0.5 {\\rm m}}{1 {\\rm s}} \\hat x \\\\\n\\vec v &= \\left(0.5, 0, 0\\right) {\\rm m/s}\n\nTherefore, the rock has a velocity of 0.5 m/s along the x-direction. In the first line of equation \n\n(4), the derivative after the arrow corresponds to when \\Delta x and \\Delta t become infinitesimal changes. Rearranging the first line of equation \n\n(4) we see that the rock moves a small increment \\Delta x each increment of time \\Delta t\\Delta x = v\\Delta t\n\nTherefore, we can think of the position equation \n\n(2) asx(t) = x_0 + \\Delta x = x_0 + vt\n\nAs long as the velocity is constant, we can use equation \n\n(2) to determine the position of an object between any two points in time.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#momentum-of-a-point-particle","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl4":"Simulating the rock","lvl3":"Momentum of a point particle","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/newmomentumandcm#simulating-the-rock","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl4":"Simulating the rock","lvl3":"Momentum of a point particle","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"content":"Review\n\nBefore proceeding, you may wish to review:\n\nAppendix 2.1 for an introduction to programming with Visual Python using \n\ntrinket.io.\n\nUnder constant velocity motion we can describe a future position of an object using the current position, the velocity, and an increment of time to progress into the future. With equation \n\n(2), we can model this motion on computer. We will use the Python language in this textbook, and in particular, we will use Visual Python so that we can apply physics to objects that visualize physical motion in 3D. To get started, we first need to define an object that will move through space. We will make a sphere call it rock. The rock object can beplaced at a position using a vector pos=vec(x,y,z).rock = sphere(pos=vec(0,0,0), color=color.green, radius=0.1)\n\nWe can define the velocity to be a vector along the x-direction also using the built-in vector function velocity=vec(vx, vy, vz). To set the velocity to the appropriate vector, it would be codedvelocity = vec(0.5, 0, 0)\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to make the velocity one of the attributes of the rock object. We should be careful to only use this method when the attribute is a property of the object, e.g.,rock.vel = vec(0.5, 0, 0)\n\nWe can visualize the velocity with a vector arrow that remains attached to the rock’s position and has a length that is the magnitude of the velocity. To do this we write the following code.arrow(pos=rock.pos, axis=rock.vel, color=color.white)\n\nTry, putting these three lines of code in the trinket below and see what happens when you run the program.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:A blank trinket to simulate a rock sliding on a frozen pond.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#simulating-the-rock","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Non-constant Momentum","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#non-constant-momentum","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Non-constant Momentum","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"content":"If the particle has a constant mass, then the time derivative of its momentum is given by:\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec p = \\frac{d}{dt}m\\vec v = m\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec v=m\\vec a\n\nand we can write this as Newton’s Second Law, since m\\vec a must be equal to the vector sum of the forces on the particle of mass m:\\boxed{\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec p = \\sum \\vec F = \\vec F^{net}}\n\nThe equation above is the original form in which Newton first developed his theory. It says that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. If the net force on the object is zero, then its momentum is constant (as is its velocity). In terms of components, Newton’s Second Law written for the rate of change of momentum is given by:\\frac{dp_x}{dt} =& \\sum F_x\\\\\n\\frac{dp_y}{dt} =& \\sum F_y\\\\\n\\frac{dp_z}{dt} =& \\sum F_z\n\nExample 4.1\n\nA particle of mass m is released from rest and allowed to fall freely under the influence of gravity near the Earth’s surface (assume that drag is negligible). Is the mechanical energy of the particle conserved? Is the momentum of the particle conserved? If momentum is not conserved, how does momentum change with time? Do your answers change if the force of drag cannot be ignored?}\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we model the falling particle assuming that there is no force of drag. The only force exerted on the particle is thus its weight.\n\nThe mechanical energy of the particle will be conserved only if there are no non-conservative forces doing work on the particle. Since the force of gravity is the only force acting on the particle, its mechanical energy is conserved.\n\nThe total momentum of the particle is not conserved, because the sum of the forces on the particle is not zero. Choosing the z axis to be vertical and positive upwards, Newton’s Second Law in the z direction is given by:\\sum F_z = -mg=\\frac{dp_z}{dt}\n\nNote that the x and y components of momentum are conserved, since there are no forces with components in that direction. We can find how the z component of the momentum changes with time by taking the anti-derivative of the force with respect to time (from t=0 to t=T):\\frac{dp_z}{dt} &= -mg\\\\\n\\int dp_z &= \\int_0^T (-mg) dt\\\\\np_z(T) - p_z(0) &= -mgT\\\\\n\\therefore p_z(T) &= p_z(0) - mgT\n\nwhere the z component of momentum, p_z(T) at some time T, is given by its value at time t=0 plus -mgT. If the object started at rest (\\vec v=0), then the magnitude of the momentum, as a function of time, is given by:p(t) = p_z(t) = -mgt\n\nand indeed changes with time.\n\nIf the force of drag were not negligible, there would be a non-conservative force acting on the particle, so its mechanical energy would no longer be conserved. The particle will accelerate until it reaches terminal velocity. During that phase of acceleration, the net force on the particle is not zero (it is accelerating), so its momentum is not conserved. Once the particle reaches terminal velocity, the net force on the particle is zero, and its momentum is conserved from then on.\n\nDiscussion: This simple example highlights the fact that mechanical energy and momentum are conserved under different conditions. Just because one is conserved does not mean that the other is conserved. It also shows that Newton’s Second Law is a statement about change in momentum, not momentum itself (just like it is a statement about acceleration, change in velocity, not velocity).","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#non-constant-momentum","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Impulse","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#impulse","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Impulse","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"content":"When we introduced the concept of energy, we started by calculating the “work”, W, done by a force exerted on an object over a specific path between two points:W = \\int_A^B \\vec F \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nWe then introduced kinetic energy, K, to be that quantity whose change is equal to the net work done on the particleW^{net} = \\int_A^B \\vec F^{net}\\cdot d\\vec l = \\Delta K\n\nwhere the net force, \\vec F^{net}, is the vector sum of the forces on the particle.\n\nWe can do the same thing, but instead of integrating the force over distance, we can integrate it over time. We thus introduce the concept of “impulse”, \\vec J, of a force, as that force integrated from an initial time, t_A, to a final time, t_B:\\vec J = \\int_{t_A}^{t_B}\\vec F dt\n\nwhere it should be clear that impulse is a vector quantity (and the above vector equation thus corresponds to one integral per component). Impulse is, in general, defined as an integral because the force, \\vec F, could change with time. If the force is constant in time (magnitude and direction), then we can define the impulse without using an integral:\\vec J = \\vec F \\Delta t\n\nwhere \\Delta t is the amount of time over which the force was exerted. Although the force might never be constant, we can sometimes use the above formula to calculate impulse using an average value of the force.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat is the SI unit for impulse?\n\n{\\rm kg\\cdot m/s^2}\n\n{\\rm kg \\cdot s^2}\n\n{\\rm kg \\cdot m/s}\n\n{\\rm kg \\cdot m/s^3}\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 4.2\n\nEstimate the impulse that is given to someone’s hand when they swat a fly on the surface of a table.\n\nSolution\n\nWhen we swat a fly with our hand, our hand exerts a force on the table surface during the period of time, \\Delta t, over which our hand is in contact with the table surface. During that period of time, the force on the hand goes from being 0, to some unpleasantly high value, and then back to zero, so the force cannot be considered constant.\n\nLet us estimate the average magnitude of the swatting force by considering the deceleration of our swatting hand and modelling the motion as one-dimensional. Let us assume that our swatting hand has a mass m=1 {\\rm kg} and that it is has a speed of 2 {\\rm m/s} just before it makes contact. Furthermore, let us assume that it is in contact with the table for a period of time \\Delta t. This allows us to find the average acceleration of our hand and thus the average force exerted by the table on our hand to stop it:a &= \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}\\\\\n\\therefore F &= ma = m  \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}\n\nBy Newton’s Third Law, the force decelerating our hand has the same magnitude as the force that our hand exerts on the table, allowing us to calculate the impulse given to the person’s hand:J &= F\\Delta t =  \\left(m  \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}\\right) \\Delta t = m\\Delta v\\\\\n&=(1 {\\rm kg})(2 {\\rm m/s})=2 {\\rm kg\\cdot m/s}\n\nDiscussion: Note that the impulse given to the table corresponds exactly to the change in momentum of the hand (\\Delta p=m\\Delta v).\n\nSo far, we calculated the impulse that is given by a single force. We can also consider the net impulse given to an object by the net force exerted on the object:\\vec J^{net} = \\int_{t_A}^{t_B}\\vec F^{net} dt\n\nCompare this to Newton’s Second Law written out using momentum:\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec p &= \\vec F^{net}\\\\\n\\int_{\\vec p_A}^{\\vec p_B} d\\vec p &=  \\int_{t_A}^{t_B}\\vec F^{net} dt\\\\\n\\vec p_B - \\vec p_A &=  \\int_{t_A}^{t_B}\\vec F^{net}dt\\\\\n\\therefore \\Delta \\vec p &= \\int_{t_A}^{t_B}\\vec F^{net}\t dt\n\nand we find that the net impulse received by a particle is precisely equal to its change in momentum:\\boxed{\\Delta \\vec p = \\vec J^{net}}\n\nThis is similar to the statement that the net work done on an object corresponds to its change in kinetic energy, although one should keep in mind that momentum is a vector quantity, unlike kinetic energy.\n\nExample 4.3\n\nA car moving with a speed of 100 {\\rm km/h} collides with a building and comes to a complete stop. The driver and passenger each have a mass of 80 {\\rm kg}. The driver wore a seat belt that extended during the collision, so that the force exerted by the seatbelt on the driver acted for about 2.5 {\\rm s}. The passenger did not wear a seat belt and instead was slowed down by the force exerted by the dashboard, over a much smaller amount of time, 0.2 {\\rm s}. Compare the average decelerating force experienced by the driver and the passenger.\n\nSolution\n\nWe can calculate the change in momentum of both people, which will be equal to the impulse they received as they collided with the seatbelt or with the dashboard. Since we know the duration in time that the forces were exerted, we can calculate the average force involved in order to give the required impulse. We can assume that this all happens in one dimension, so we use scalar quantities instead of vectors.\n\nThe change in momentum along the direction of motion for either the driver or passenger is given by:\\Delta p = p_B - p_A = (0)-p_A=-mv_A\n\nwhere v_A is the initial speed of the car, and the final momentum of either person is zero.\n\nThe change in momentum is equal to the impulse received by either person during a period of time \\Delta t, which is related to the force that was exerted on them:J=F\\Delta t &= \\Delta p = -mv_A\\\\\nF&=-m \\frac{v_A}{\\Delta t}\n\nFor the driver, this corresponds:F=(80 {\\rm kg})\\frac{(27.8 {\\rm m/s})}{(2.5 {\\rm s})}=890 {\\rm N}\n\nand for the passenger:F=(80 {\\rm kg})\\frac{(27.8 {\\rm m/s})}{(0.2 {\\rm s})}=11120 {\\rm N}\n\nThe force on the driver is thus comparable to their weight, whereas the passenger experiences an average force that is more than 10 times their weight.\n\nDiscussion: Any mechanism that results in a longer collision time will help to reduce the forces that are involved. This is why cars are designed to crumple in head-on collisions. We can understand this in terms of the crumpling of the car absorbing some of the kinetic energy of the car, as well as lengthening the time of the collision so that the forces involved are smaller. You may also hear people that look at modern cars that are all crumpled up after a crash and say something along the lines of “They sure don’t make cars the way they used to”. But of course, that is by design; it is safer if the car crumples up (and cars are designed to crumple up in specific areas, not the passenger cabin).\n\nNote that we did not need to use impulse to calculate the average force, since we could have just used kinematics to determine the acceleration and Newton’s Second Law to calculate the corresponding force. Using impulse is equivalent by construction, but sometimes, it is easier mathematically.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#impulse","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Systems of particles: internal and external forces","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#systems-of-particles-internal-and-external-forces","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Systems of particles: internal and external forces","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"content":"So far, we have only used Newton’s Second Law to describe the motion of a single point mass particle or to describe the motion of an object whose orientation we did not need to describe (e.g. a block sliding down a hill). In this section, we consider what happens when there are multiple point particles that form a “system”.\n\nIn physics, we loosely define a system as the ensemble of objects/particles that we wish to describe. So far, we have only described systems made of one particle, so describing the motion of the system was equivalent to describing the motion of that single particle. A  system of two particles could be, for example, two billiard balls on a pool table. To describe that system, we would need to provide functions that describe the positions, velocities, and forces exerted on both balls. We can also define functions/quantities that describe the system as a whole, rather than the details. For example, we can define the total kinetic energy of the system, K, corresponding to the sum of kinetic energies of the two balls. We can also define the total momentum of the system, \\vec P, given by the vector sum of the momenta of the two balls.\n\nWhen considering a system of multiple particles, we distinguish between internal and external forces. Internal forces are those forces that the particles in the system exert on each other. For example, if the two billiard balls in the system collide with each other, they will each exert a force on the other during the collision; those forces are internal. External forces are all other forces exerted on the particles of the system. For example, the force of gravity and the normal force from the pool table are both external forces exerted on the balls in the system (exerted by the Earth, or by the pool table, neither of which we considered to be part of the system). The force exerted by a person hitting one of the balls with a pool queue is similarly an external force. What we consider to be a system is arbitrary; we could consider the pool table and the Earth to be part of the system along with the two balls; in that case, the normal force and the weight of the balls would become internal forces. The classification of whether a force is internal or external to a system of course depends on what is considered part of the system.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nTwo pool balls crash against each other. Is this force of gravity exerted by one ball on the other an internal or external force?\n\nInternal.\n\nExternal.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe key property of internal forces is that the vector sum of the internal forces in a system is zero. Indeed, Newton’s Third Law states that for every force exerted by object A on object B, there is a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction exerted by object B on object A. If we consider both objects to be in the same system, then the sum of the internal forces between objects A and B must sum to zero. It is important to note that this is quite different than what we have discussed so far about summing forces. The forces that sum to zero are exerted on different objects. Thus far, we had only ever considered summing forces that are exerted on the same object in order to apply Newton’s Second Law. We have never encountered a situation where “action” and “reaction” forces are summed together, because they act on different objects.\n\nEmma’s Thoughts\n\nInternal vs. External forces - what is the “system” and what forces should we consider?\n\nAs discussed above, internal and external forces can only be considered in the context of a specific system. So, how do we define this “system”? How far do we go when defining the system?\n\nFor example, let’s say that you kick a soccer ball, and it hits a nearby lawn chair, knocking it down. You want to determine what will happen to the soccer ball after it hits the lawn chair. What is defined to be the system here, and how should the forces be classified? Is the force exerted by the soccer ball on the lawn chair an external force? Should we consider the friction between the first foot particle that touches the first soccer ball particle?\n\nThe best way to approach “defining the system” is to pin down exactly what you’re trying to model. Here, specifically, you are trying to determine the velocity of the ball after it hits the lawn chair. In this situation, thinking about the friction between individual foot and soccer ball particles wouldn’t help us to figure out the final velocity of the soccer ball. Rather, thinking of the soccer ball and lawn chair as two giant, continuous particles, colliding and exchanging energy would be helpful. In this situation, it would be useful to consider the “system” to be the soccer ball and lawn chair only.\n\nThe force exerted by the soccer ball on the lawn chair would be an internal force, as this gives us information as to the final velocity of the soccer ball and is a force exchanged between the particles within the system. The force that gravity exerts on the lawn chair, normal force on the person’s foot and the force exerted by the foot on the soccer ball are all forces that we would consider “external”.\n\nRemember - “internal” and “external” are not magical properties of a specific type of force. These definitions are made by us in the quest of building useful models.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#systems-of-particles-internal-and-external-forces","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Conservation of momentum","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#conservation-of-momentum","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Conservation of momentum","lvl2":"Momentum and Newton’s First Law"},"content":"Consider a system of two particles with momenta \\vec p_1 and \\vec p_2.

We can sum these two equations together:\\frac{d\\vec p_1}{dt}+\\frac{d\\vec p_2}{dt} &= \\sum_k \\vec F_{1k} + \\sum_k \\vec F_{2k}\n\nThe quantity on the right is the sum of the forces exerted on particle 1 plus the sum of the forces exerted on particle 2. In other words, it is the sum of all of the forces exerted on all of the particles in the system, which we can write as a single sum. On the left hand side, we have the sum of the two time derivatives of the momenta, which is equal to the time-derivative of the sum of the momenta. We can thus re-write the equation as:\\frac{d}{dt}(\\vec p_1 + \\vec p_2) = \\sum \\vec F\n\nwhere, again, the sum on the right is the sum over all of the forces exerted on the system. Some of those forces are external (e.g. gravity exerted by Earth on the particles), whereas some of the forces are internal (e.g. a contact force between the two particles). We can separate the sum into a sum over all external forces (\\vec F^{ext}) and a sum over internal forces (\\vec F^{int}):\\sum \\vec F = \\sum \\vec F^{ext} + \\sum \\vec F^{int}\n\nThe sum of the internal forces is zero:\\sum \\vec F^{int} = 0\n\nbecause for every force that particle 1 exerts on particle 2, there will be an equal and opposite force exerted by particle 2 on particle 1. We thus have:\\frac{d}{dt}(\\vec p_1 + \\vec p_2) = \\sum \\vec F^{ext}\n\nFurthermore, if we introduce the “total momentum of the system”, \\vec P=\\vec p_1 + \\vec p_2, as the sum of the momenta of the individual particles, we find:\\frac{d\\vec P}{dt} &= \\sum \\vec F^{ext}\n\nwhich is the equivalent of Newton’s Second Law for a system where, \\vec P, is the total momentum of the system, and the sum of the forces is only over external forces to the system.\n\nNote that the derivation above easily extends to any number, N, of particles, even though we only did it with N=2. In general, for the “ith particle”, with momentum \\vec p_i, we can write Newton’s Second Law:\\frac{d\\vec p_i}{dt}=\\sum_k \\vec F_{ik}\n\nwhere the sum is over only those forces exerted on particle i. Summing the above equation for all N particles in the system:\\frac{d}{dt}\\sum_i \\vec p_i=\\sum \\vec F^{ext} + \\sum \\vec F^{int}\n\nwhere the sum over internal forces will vanish for the same reason as above. Introducing the total momentum of the system, \\vec P:\\vec P = \\sum_i \\vec p_i\\\\\n\nWe can write an equation for the time-derivative of the total momentum of the system:\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec P}{dt} = \\sum \\vec F^{ext}}\n\nwhere the sum of the forces is the sum over all forces external to the system. Thus, if there are no external forces on a system, then the total momentum of that system is conserved (if the time-derivative of a quantity is zero then that quantity is constant).\n\nWe already argued in the previous section that we can make all forces internal if we choose our system to be large enough. If we make the system be the Universe, then there are no forces external to the Universe, and the total momentum of the Universe must be constant:\\frac{d\\vec P^{Universe}}{dt} &= \\sum_{Universe} \\vec F^{ext} = 0 \\\\\n\\therefore \\vec P^{Universe}&=\\text{constant}\n\nIn summary, we saw that:\n\nIf no forces are exerted on a single particle, then the momentum of that particle is constant (conserved).\n\nIn a system of particles, the total momentum of the system is conserved if there are no external forces on the system.\n\nIf there are no non-conservative forces exerted on a particle, then that particle’s mechanical energy is constant (conserved).\n\nIn a system of multiple particles, the total mechanical energy of the system will be conserved if there are no non-conservative forces exerted on the system.\n\nWhen we refer to a force being “exerted on a system”, we mean exerted on one or more of the particles in the system. In particular, the sum of the work done by internal forces is not necessarily zero, so energy and momentum are thus conserved under different conditions.\n\nExample 4.4\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A train with N cars of mass m about to collide with a car of mass m that is at rest on the track.\n\nConsider a train made of N cars of equal mass m that is travelling at constant speed v along a straight piece of track where friction and drag are negligible, as depicted in \n\nFigure 4. An empty car of mass m was left at rest on the track in front of the train. The train collides with the empty car which stays attached to the front of the train. What is the speed of the train after the collision? Is the total mechanical energy of the system conserved?\n\nSolution\n\nWhen the train collides with the car, it will exert a “collision” force on the car, and the car will exert an opposite force on the train. If we consider both of the train and the car as being part of the same system, then those collision forces will be internal, and the momentum of the system (train + car) will be conserved. The train and car both experience external forces from Earth’s gravity and the normal force from the train tracks. However, those two sets of forces cancel each other out, since neither the train nor the car have any acceleration in the vertical direction (the sum of the forces on each object has no net vertical component). Thus, there are no net external forces on the car+train system, and the total momentum of the system is conserved through the collision.\n\nWe can model this system in one dimension (along the track), defining our x axis. We choose the ground as a frame of reference, the positive direction parallel to the initial velocity of the train, and the origin to be located where the car initially starts. Before the collision, the x component of the momenta of the train (mass Nm) and car (mass m) are:p_{train}&=Nmv\\\\\np_{car}&=0\n\nAfter the collision, the car is attached to the train (and thus has the same speed, v'), so the momenta of the train and car after the collision are:p'_{train}&=Nmv'\\\\\np'_{car}&=mv'\n\nwhere the primes ' denote quantities after the collision. Applying conservation of momentum to the system, the total momentum before and after the collision must be equal:p_{train}+p_{car}&=p'_{train}+p'_{car}\\\\\n\\therefore Nmv &= Nmv' +mv'\\\\\n\\therefore v' &=\\frac{N}{N+1}v\n\nand the speed of the train with the additional car attached is reduced by a factor N/(N+1) compared to what it was before the collision.\n\nWe can check to see if the mechanical energy of the system is conserved, since we know the speeds of the train and car before and after the collision. Since all of the motion is horizontal, gravity and the normal force do no work on either the train or car, so their mechanical energy can be taken as their kinetic energy (their gravitational potential energy does not change after the collision). The total mechanical energy of the system, E, before the collision is the kinetic energy of the train:E= \\frac{1}{2}Nmv^2\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system, E', after the collision is:E' &= \\frac{1}{2}Nmv'^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv'^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(N+1)mv'^2 \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}(N+1)m \\left( \\frac{N}{N+1}v \\right)^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}m\\frac{N^2}{N+1}v^2\n\nand we see that E'<E, and thus that the total mechanical energy of the system is not conserved (it is reduced after the collision).\n\n**Discussion: **We could have solved this problem by carefully modelling the force exerted by the car on the train during the collision, which would have allowed us to find the speed of the train after the collision using its acceleration. This would have required a detailed model for that force, which we do not have. However, by realizing that the train and car could be considered as a system with no net external forces exert on it, we were able to easily find the speed of the train after the collision using conservation of momentum.\n\nWe also found that mechanical energy was not conserved. This makes physical sense because, for the car to remain attached to the train, there presumably had to be some significant forces in play that “crushed” the car into the train. Some of the initial kinetic energy of the train was used to deform the train and the car during the collision. We can also think of deforming a material as giving it energy. Sometimes that energy is recoverable (e.g. compressing a spring), sometimes, it is not (e.g. crushing a car).\n\nIf the car and train were equipped with large springs to absorb the energy of the impact, the collision could have conserved mechanical energy, as the springs compress and then expand back. The speed of the car and train would then be different after the collision in this case (see \n\nExample 4.7). It is a feature of collisions where the two bodies remain attached to each other that mechanical energy is not conserved.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#conservation-of-momentum","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Collisions"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/newmomentumandcm#collisions","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Collisions"},"content":"In this section we go through a few examples of applying conservation of momentum to model collisions. Collisions can loosely be defined as events where the momenta of individual particles in a system are different before and after the event.\n\nWe distinguish between two types of collisions: elastic and inelastic collisions.

Inelastic collisions are those for which the total mechanical energy of the system is not conserved. In either case, to model the system, one chooses to define the system such that there are no external forces on the system so that total momentum is conserved.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#collisions","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Inelastic collisions","lvl2":"Collisions"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#inelastic-collisions","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Inelastic collisions","lvl2":"Collisions"},"content":"In this section, we give a few examples of modelling inelastic collisions. Inelastic collisions are usually easier to handle mathematically, because one only needs to consider conservation of momentum and does not use conservation of energy (which usually involves equations that are quadratic in the speeds because of the kinetic energy term).\n\nExample 4.5\n\n\n\nFigure 5:One skater pushing another on a frictionless horizontal surface.\n\nYou (mass m_s) and your friend (mass m_f) face each other on ice skates on an ice surface that is slippery enough that friction can be considered negligible, as shown in \n\nFigure 5. You shove your friend away from you so that he moves with velocity \\vec v_f away from you (the velocity is measured relative to the ice). Is the collision elastic? What is your speed relative to the ice after you shoved your friend?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can consider the system as being comprised of you and your friend. There are no net external forces on the system (gravity and normal forces cancel each other), so the momentum of the system will be conserved.\n\nThe mechanical energy will not be conserved. You had to use chemical potential energy stored in your muscles to shove your friend. Thus, external energy (i.e. not mechanical energy from you or your friend) was injected into the system, and we should expect the total mechanical energy to be larger after the collision.\n\nBefore the collision, both you and your friend have zero speed, and thus zero kinetic energy and zero momentum. After the collision, your friend has a velocity \\vec v_f. We can use conservation of total momentum, \\vec P, to determine your velocity, \\vec v_s, after the collision.\\vec P &=\\vec P'\\\\\n0 &= m_s\\vec v_s + m_f\\vec v_f\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec v_s &= -\\frac{m_f}{m_s}\\vec v_f\n\nwhere primes (') denote a quantity after the collision. We find that your velocity is in the opposite direction from that of your friend. Before the collision, the mechanical energy, E, of the system is zero (we can ignore gravitational potential energy, since everything is in the horizontal plane). After the collision, the mechanical energy, E', is:E' = \\frac{1}{2}m_sv_s^2+\\frac{1}{2}m_fv_f^2\n\nwhich is clearly bigger than the mechanical energy before the collision (i.e. 0), as we suspected it would be.\n\nDiscussion: We find that you recoil in the opposite direction, which makes sense. If you push your friend in one direction, Newton’s Third Law says that your friend pushes you in the opposite direction. Your speed furthermore depends on the ratio of your friend’s mass to yours. This also makes sense, because if you both feel the same force, the person with the smallest mass will have the highest speed; if your mass is higher than your friend’s, then your speed after the collision will be smaller than your friend’s.\n\nWe also saw that mechanical energy was not conserved. In terms of energy, we can explain this by saying that you burned up chemical potential energy stored in your muscles in order to shove your friend. Because we included both you and your friend in the system, the shove was an internal force and momentum is conserved. Of course, if we had considered only you as the system, then your momentum would not have been conserved during the collision.\n\nThe type of collision that we described here is also sometimes called an “explosion”. You can imagine all of the parts that make up a bomb as small particles. When the bomb explodes, chemical potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the bomb fragments. If you consider all of the particles/fragments of the bomb as a system, then the total momentum of all of the bomb fragments is conserved (and equal to zero if the bomb was initially at rest). Again, mechanical energy would not be conserved (and would increase) as the chemical potential energy is converted into mechanical energy.\n\nExample 4.6\n\nA proton of mass m_p and initial velocity \\vec v_p collides inelastically with a nucleus of mass m_N at rest, as shown in \n\nFigure 6. A coordinate system is set up as shown, such that the initial velocity of the proton is in the x direction. After the collision, the proton’s speed is measured to be v'_p and its velocity vector is found to make an angle θ with the x axis as shown. What is the velocity vector of the nucleus after the collision? Assume that the collision takes place in vacuum.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A proton of mass m_p colliding inelastically with a nucleus of mass m_N.\n\nSolution\n\nAs a system, we consider the proton and the nucleus together, so that the total momentum of the system is conserved during the collision, as no other external forces are exerted on the two particles (since they are in vacuum). Because momentum is a vector, each component of the total momentum, \\vec P, is conserved during the collision:\\vec P &= \\vec P'\\\\\n\\therefore P_x &= P'_x\\\\\n\\therefore P_y &= P'_y\n\nwhere, as usual, primes (') denote quantities after the collision. After the collision, both particles will have velocity vectors that have x and y components. Let the velocity vector of the nucleus after the collision be \\vec v'_N and let ϕ be the angle that it makes with the x axis, as shown in \n\nFigure 6.\n\nWe can start by considering the conservation of the x component of the total momentum. The initial and final momenta in the x direction are given by:P_x &= m_p v_p\\\\\nP'_x &= m_p v'_p\\cos\\theta + m_N v'_N\\cos\\phi\\\\\n\\therefore m_p v_p &= m_p v'_p\\cos\\theta + m_N v'_N\\cos\\phi\n\nwhich gives us a first equation to determine the final velocity of the nucleus.\n\nThe y component of the total momentum before the collision is zero since we chose the coordinate system such that the initial velocity of the proton is in the x direction. The initial and final momenta in the y direction are given by:P_y &= 0\\\\\nP'_y &= m_p v'_p\\sin\\theta - m_N v'_N\\sin\\phi\\\\\n\\therefore m_p v'_p\\sin\\theta &= m_N v'_N\\sin\\phi\n\nwhich gives us a second equation to solve for the velocity of the nucleus. With the two equations from momentum conservation, we can solve for the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the nucleus. From the y component of momentum conservation, we can find an expression for the speed of the nucleus:m_p v'_p\\sin\\theta &= m_N v'_N\\sin\\phi\\\\\n\\therefore v'_N &= \\frac{m_p}{m_N}v'_p\\sin\\theta \\frac{1}{\\sin\\phi}\n\nwhich we can substitute into the x equation for momentum conservation to solve for the angle ϕ:m_p v_p &= m_p v'_p\\cos\\theta + m_N v'_N\\cos\\phi\\\\\nm_p v_p &= m_p v'_p\\cos\\theta + m_N\\frac{m_p}{m_N}v'_p\\sin\\theta \\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\sin\\phi} \\\\\nv_p &= v'_p\\cos\\theta + v'_p\\sin\\theta \\frac{1}{\\tan\\phi}\\\\\n\\therefore \\tan\\phi &=  \\frac{v'_p\\sin\\theta}{v_p-v'_p\\cos\\theta}\n\nIf we were given numbers for the initial and final speed of the proton, as well as the angle θ, we would be able to find a value for the angle ϕ, which we could then use to determine the final speed of the nucleus: v'_N &= \\frac{m_p}{m_N}v'_p\\sin\\theta \\frac{1}{\\sin\\phi}\n\nDiscussion: By using the conservation of momentum equation and writing out the x and y components, we were able to find two equations to determine the magnitude and direction of the nucleus’ velocity after the collision. In the limit where m_N >> m_p, the final speed of the nucleus would be very small (close to zero).","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#inelastic-collisions","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Elastic collisions","lvl2":"Collisions"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#elastic-collisions","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Elastic collisions","lvl2":"Collisions"},"content":"In this section, we give a few examples of modelling elastic collisions. Even though it is mechanical energy that is conserved in an elastic collision, one can almost always simplify this to only kinetic energy being conserved. If a collision takes place in a well localized position in space (i.e. before and after the collision are the same point in space), then the potential energies of the objects involved will not change, thus any change in their mechanical energy is due to a change in kinetic energy.\n\nExample 4.7\n\n\n\nFigure 7:Two blocks about to collide elastically.\n\nA block of mass M moves with velocity \\vec v_M in the x direction, as shown in \n\nFigure 7. A block of mass m is moving with velocity \\vec v_m also in the x direction and collides elastically with block M. Both blocks slide with no friction on the horizontal surface. What are the velocities of the two blocks after the collision?\n\nSolution\n\nBecause this is an elastic collision, both the total momentum and total mechanical energy are conserved. Equating the total momentum before and after the collision, and considering only the x component gives the following equation:\\vec P &=\\vec P'\\\\\nMv_M+mv_m&=Mv'_M+mv'_m\n\nwhere the primes (') correspond to the quantities after the collision. Note that, in principle, the x components of the velocities (v_M, v'_M, v_m, v'_m) could be negative numbers if the corresponding block is moving in the negative x direction.\n\nFor the mechanical energy of the two blocks, we only need to consider their kinetic energy since their gravitational potential energies are the same before and after the collision on the horizontal surface. The total mechanical energy of the system, before and after the collision is given by:E &=E'\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}Mv_M^2+\\frac{1}{2}mv_m^2&=\\frac{1}{2}Mv'^2_M+\\frac{1}{2}mv'^2_m\\\\\n\\therefore Mv_M^2+mv_m^2&=Mv'^2_M+mv'^2_m\n\nwhere we cancelled the factor of one half in the last line. This gives two equations (conservation of energy and momentum) and two unknowns (the two speeds after the collision). This is not a linear system of equations, because the equation from conservation of energy is quadratic in the speeds.\n\nThe following method allows many models for elastic collisions between two particles to be solved easily by converting the quadratic equation from energy conservation into an equation that is linear in the speeds. First, write both equations so that the quantities related to each particle are on opposite sides of the equation. For momentum, this gives:Mv_M+mv_m&=Mv'_M+mv'_m\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore M(v_M-v'_M) &= m(v'm-v_m)\n\nFor conservation of energy, this gives:Mv_M^2+mv_m^2&=Mv'^2_M+mv'^2_m\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore  M(v_M^2-v'^2_M)&= M(v'^2_m-v^2_m)\n\nwhich we can re-write as:M(v_M^2-v'^2_M)&= M(v'^2_m-v^2_m)\\\\\nM(v_M-v'_M)(v_M+v'_M)&= M(v'_m-v_m)(v'_m+v_m)\n\nWe can then divide Equation \n\n(54) by Equation \n\n(53):\\frac{M(v_M-v'_M)(v_M+v'_M)}{M(v_M-v'_M)}&= \\frac{M(v'_m-v_m)(v'_m+v_m)}{m(v'm-v_m)}\\\\\n\\therefore v_M+v'_M&=v'_m+v_m\n\nwhich gives us an equation that is much easier to work with, since it is linear in the speeds. If we re-arrange this last equation back so that quantities before and after the collision are on different sides of the equality:\\boxed{v_M-v_m = - (v'_M-v'_m)}\n\nwe can see that the relative speed between M and m is the same before and after the collision. That is, if block M “saw” block m approaching with a speed of 3 {\\rm m/s} before the collision, it would “see” block m moving away with speed 3 {\\rm m/s} after the collision, regardless of the actual directions and velocities of the block, if the collision was elastic.\n\nBy using this equation with the original conservation of momentum equation, we now have two equations and two unknowns that are easy to solve:v_M-v_m &= - (v'_M-v'_m)\\\\\nMv_M+mv_m&=Mv'_M+mv'_m\n\nSolving for v'_m in both equations gives:v_M-v_m &= - (v'_M-v'_m)\\\\\n\\therefore v'_m &= v_M+v'_M-v_m\\\\\nMv_M+mv_m&=Mv'_M+mv'_m\\\\\n\\therefore v'_m&=\\frac{1}{m}(Mv_M+mv_m-Mv'_M)\n\nEquating the two expressions for v'_m allows us to solve for v'_M:\\frac{1}{m}(Mv_M+mv_m-Mv'_M)&=v_M+v'_M-v_m\\\\\nMv_M+mv_m-Mv'_M&=mv_M+mv'_M-mv_m\\\\\n(M-m)v_M+2mv_m&=(M+m)v'_M\\\\\n\\therefore v'_M&=\\frac{M-m}{M+m}v_M+\\frac{2m}{M+m}v_m\n\nOne can easily solve for the other speed, v'_m:\\therefore v'_m &= \\frac{m-M}{M+m}v_m+\\frac{2M}{M+m}v_M\n\nAnd writing these together:v'_M&=\\frac{M-m}{M+m}v_M+\\frac{2m}{M+m}v_m\\\\\nv'_m &= \\frac{m-M}{M+m}v_m+\\frac{2M}{M+m}v_M\n\nDiscussion: The formulas that we obtained above are valid for any one dimensional elastic collision.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nTwo trains of equal masses collide elastically on a track. If train A had a speed v and train B was at rest, what are the speeds of the trains after the collision?\n\nBoth trains A and B travel away from each other with speeds \\frac{1}{2}v.\n\nTrain A will be at rest and train B will move away with a speed v.\n\nBoth trains A and B will stick together and move at a speed of v.\n\nTrain B will be at rest and train A will move away at a speed of v.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 4.8\n\n\n\nFigure 8:A proton elastically collides with a proton at rest.\n\nA proton of mass m and initial velocity \\vec v_1 collides elastically with a second proton that is at rest. After the collision, the two protons have velocities \\vec v'_1 and \\vec v'_2, as shown in \n\nFigure 8. Show that the velocity vectors of the two protons are perpendicular after the collision.\n\nSolution\n\nThis example highlights a particular feature of elastic collisions when the two objects have the same mass and one of the objects is initially at rest. The conservation of momentum for the system comprised of the two protons can be written as:m\\vec v_1 &= m\\vec v'_1 + m\\vec v'_2\\\\\n\\vec v_1 &= \\vec v'_1 + \\vec v'_2\n\nwhere the left hand side corresponds to the initial total momentum and the right hand side to the total momentum after the collision. In the second line, we cancelled out the mass, and obtained a vector relation between the velocity vectors. We can graphically illustrate the vector relation as in \n\nFigure 9 which shows the triangle that is formed by adding the two outgoing velocity vectors to obtain the initial velocity vector.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:Graphical illustration of the relation between the initial and final velocity vectors as a vector sum.\n\nConservation of kinetic energy for the collision can be written as:\\frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 &= \\frac{1}{2}mv'^2_1+\\frac{1}{2}mv'^2_2\\\\\nv_1^2 &= v'^2_1+ v'^2_2\n\nwhere the left hand side corresponds to the initial kinetic energy and the right hand side to the final kinetic energy. We cancelled the mass and factor of one half in the second line. This last equation gives a relation between the magnitudes of the velocity vectors. By comparing the equation above to Pythagoras’ theorem, and by inspecting the triangle in \n\nFigure 9, it is clear that the triangle must be a right angle triangle, and thus that \\vec v'_1 and \\vec v'_2 must be perpendicular.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#elastic-collisions","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Frames of reference","lvl2":"Collisions"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#frames-of-reference","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Frames of reference","lvl2":"Collisions"},"content":"Review\n\nBefore proceeding, you may wish to review Sections \n\n and  \n\n on expressing velocities in different frames of reference.\n\nBecause the momentum of a particle is defined using the velocity of the particle, its value depends on the reference frame in which we chose to measure that velocity. In some cases, it is useful to apply momentum conservation in a frame of reference where the total momentum of the system is zero. For example, consider two particles of mass m_1 and m_2, moving towards each other with velocities \\vec v_1 and \\vec v_2, respectively, as measured in a frame of reference S, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 10.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Two particles moving towards each other.\n\nIn the frame of reference S, the total momentum, \\vec P, of the two particles can be written:\\vec P = m_1\\vec v_1 + m_2\\vec v_2\n\nConsider a frame of reference, S', that is moving with velocity, \\vec v_{CM}, relative to the frame of reference S. In that frame of reference, the velocities of the two particles are different and given by:\\vec v'_1&=\\vec v_1- \\vec v_{CM}\\\\\n\\vec v'_2&=\\vec v_2- \\vec v_{CM}\n\nThe total momentum, \\vec P', in the frame of reference S' is then given by:\\vec P' &= m_1\\vec v'_1 + m_2 \\vec v'_2\\\\\n&=m_1(\\vec v_1- \\vec v_{CM})+m_2(\\vec v_2- \\vec v_{CM})\\\\\n&= m_1\\vec v_1 + m_2\\vec v_2 - (m_1+m_2) \\vec v_{CM}\n\nWe can choose the velocity of the frame S', \\vec v_{CM}, such that the total momentum in that frame of reference is zero:\\vec P' &= 0\\\\\nm_1\\vec v_1 + m_2\\vec v_2 - (m_1+m_2) \\vec v_{CM} &=0\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec v_{CM} &= \\frac{m_1\\vec v_1 + m_2\\vec v_2 }{m_1+m_2}\n\nThis “special” frame of reference, in which the total momentum of the system is zero, is called the “centre of mass frame of reference”. The velocity of centre of mass frame of reference can easily be obtained if there are N particles involved instead of two:\\boxed{\\therefore \\vec v_{CM} = \\frac{m_1\\vec v_1 + m_2\\vec v_2 + m_3 \\vec v_3 + \\dots }{m_1+m_2+m_3+\\dots}=\\frac{\\sum m_i\\vec v_i}{\\sum m_i}}\n\nAgain, you should note that because the above equation is a vector equation, it represents one equation per component of the vectors. For example, the x component of the velocity of the centre of mass frame of reference is given by:\\therefore  v_{CMx} = \\frac{m_1 v_{1x} + m_2v_{2x} + m_3 v_{3x} + \\dots }{m_1+m_2+m_3+\\dots}=\\frac{\\sum m_iv_{ix}}{\\sum m_i}\n\nExample 4.9\n\n\n\nFigure 11:One block approaching another identical block at rest, as seen in the lab frame of reference.\n\nIn the frame of reference of a lab, a block of mass m has a velocity \\vec v_1 directed along the positive x axis and is approaching a second block of mass m that is at rest (\\vec v_2=0), as shown in \n\nFigure 11. What is the velocity of the centre of mass frame? What is the velocity of each block in the centre of mass frame? Verify that the total momentum is zero in the centre of mass frame.\n\nSolution\n\nSince this is a one dimensional situation, we only need to evaluate the x component of the velocity of the centre of mass:\\vec v_{CM} &= \\frac{m_1\\vec v_1 + m_2\\vec v_2 }{m_1+m_2}\\\\\n\\therefore v_{CMx} &= \\frac{m_1 v_{1x} + m_2 v_{2x}}{m_1+m_2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{mv_1 + m(0) }{m+m}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}v_1\n\nThe centre of mass frame of reference is thus also moving along the positive direction of the x axis, but with a speed that is half of that of the moving block. In the centre of mass frame of reference, it appears that the block on the left is slower than in the lab frame and that the block on the right is moving in the negative x direction. The velocities of the two blocks in the centre of mass frame of reference are given by:v'_1&=v_1-v_{CMx}=\\frac{1}{2}v_1\\\\\nv'_2&=(0)-v_{CMx}=-\\frac{1}{2}v_1\n\nThus, in the reference frame of the centre of mass, the two block are approaching each other with the same speed (v_1/2), which is only the case because the two blocks have the same mass. The blocks, as viewed in the centre of mass frame of reference, are shown in \n\nFigure 12.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:In the centre of mass frame of reference, the block approach each other with the same speed, because they have the same mass.\n\nClearly, the total momentum is zero in the centre of mass frame of reference:\\vec P' = m\\vec v'_1+ m\\vec v'_2 = m \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\vec v_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec v_1\\right) = 0\n\nDiscussion: As we have seen, in the centre of mass frame of reference the total momentum is zero. If there are only two particles, and they have the same mass, then, in the centre of mass frame of reference, they both have the same speed and move either towards or away from each other.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#frames-of-reference","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The centre of mass"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/newmomentumandcm#the-centre-of-mass","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The centre of mass"},"content":"In this section, we show how to generalize Newton’s Second Law so that it may describe the motion of an object that is not a point particle. Any object can be described as being made up of point particles; for example, those particles could be the atoms that make up regular matter. We can thus use the same terminology as in the previous sections to describe a complicated object as a “system” comprised of many point particles, themselves described by Newton’s Second Law. A system could be a rigid object where the point particles cannot move relative to each other, such as atoms in a solid. Or, the system could be a gas, made of many atoms moving around, or it could be a combination of many solid objects moving around.\n\nIn the previous section, we saw how the total momentum and the total mechanical energy of the system could be used to describe the system as a whole. In this section, we will define the centre of mass which will allow us to describe the position of the system as a whole.\n\nConsider a system comprised of N point particles. Each point particle i, of mass m_i, can be described by a position vector, \\vec r_i, a velocity vector, \\vec v_i, and an acceleration vector, \\vec a_i, relative to some coordinate system in an inertial frame of reference. Newton’s Second Law can be applied to any one of the particles in the system:\\sum_k \\vec F_{ik} = m_i \\vec a_i\n\nwhere \\vec F_{ik} is the k-th force exerted on particle i. We can write Newton’s Second Law once for each of the N particles, and we can sum those N equations together:\\sum_k \\vec F_{1k} + \\sum_k \\vec F_{2k} + \\sum_k \\vec F_{3k} +\\dots &= m_1\\vec a_1 + m_2 \\vec a_2 + m_3 \\vec a_3 + \\dots\\\\\n\\sum \\vec F = \\sum_i m_i \\vec a_i\n\nwhere the sum on the left is the sum of all of the forces exerted on all of the particles in the system and the sum over i on the right is over all of the N particles in the system. As we have already seen, the sum of all of the forces exerted on the system can be divided into separate sums over external and internal forces:\\sum \\vec F = \\sum \\vec F^{ext} + \\sum \\vec F^{int}\n\nand the sum over the internal forces is zero. We can thus write that the sum of the external forces exerted on the system is given by:\\sum \\vec F^{ext}&= \\sum_i m_i \\vec a_i\n\nWe would like this equation to resemble Newton’s Second Law, but for the system as a whole. Suppose that the system has a total mass, M:M = m_1 + m_2 + m_3 +\\dots = \\sum_i m_i\n\nwe would like to have an equation of the form:\\sum \\vec F^{ext}&=M\\vec a_{CM}\n\nto describe the system as a whole. However, it is not (yet) clear what is accelerating with acceleration, \\vec a_{CM}, since the particles in the system could all be moving in different directions. Suppose that there is a point in the system, whose position is given by the vector, \\vec r_{CM}, in such a way that the acceleration above is the second time-derivative of that position vector:\\vec a_{CM} = \\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_{CM}\n\nWe can compare Equations \n\n(77) and \n\n(79) to determine what the position vector \\vec r_{CM} corresponds to:\\sum \\vec F^{ext}&= \\sum_i m_i \\vec a_i = \\sum_i m_i \\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_i \\\\\n\\sum \\vec F^{ext}&=M\\vec a_{CM} = M \\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_{CM}\\\\\n\\therefore M \\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_{CM}&= \\sum_i m_i \\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_i\n\nRe-arranging, and noting that the masses are constant in time, and so they can be factored into the derivatives:\\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i \\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_i\\\\\n\\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\vec r_{CM} &= \\frac{d^2 }{dt^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i\\vec r_i \\right)\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec r_{CM} &=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i\\vec r_i\n\nwhere in the last line we set the quantities that have the same time derivative equal to each other. \\vec r_{CM} is the vector that describes the position of the “centre of mass” (CM). The position of the centre of mass is described by Newton’s Second Law applied to the system as a whole:\\boxed{\\sum \\vec F^{ext}=M\\vec a_{CM}}\n\nwhere M is the total mass of the system, and the sum of the forces is the sum over only external forces on the system.\n\nAlthough we have formally derived Newton’s Second Law for a system of particles, we really have been using this result throughout the text. For example, when we modelled a block sliding down an incline, we never worried that the block was made of many atoms all interacting with each other and the surroundings. Instead, we only considered the external forces on the block, namely, the normal force from the incline, any frictional forces, and the total weight of the object (the force exerted by gravity). Technically, the force of gravity is not exerted on the block as a whole, but on each of the atoms. However, when we sum the force of gravity exerted on each atom:m_1\\vec g+ m_2 \\vec g + m_3\\vec g + \\dots = (m_1+m_2+m_3+\\dots)\\vec g = M\\vec g\n\nwe find that it can be modelled by considering the block as a single particle of mass M upon which gravity is exerted. The centre of mass is sometimes described as the “centre of gravity”, because it corresponds to the location where we can model the total force of gravity, M\\vec g, as being exerted. When we applied Newton’s Second Law to the block, we then described the motion of the block as a whole (and not the motion of the individual atoms). Specifically, we modelled the motion of the centre of mass of the block.\n\nThe position of the centre of mass is a vector equation that is true for each coordinate:\\vec r_{CM} &=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i\\vec r_i\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore x_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i x_i\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore y_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i y_i\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore z_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i z_i\n\nThe centre of mass is that position in a system that is described by Newton’s Second Law when it is applied to the system as a whole. The centre of mass can be thought of as an average position for the system (it is the average of the positions of the particles in the system, weighted by their mass). By describing the position of the centre of mass, we are not worried about the detailed positions of the all of the particles in the system, but rather only the average position of the system as a whole. In other words, this is equivalent to viewing the whole system as a single particle of mass M located at the position of the centre of mass.\n\nConsider, for example, a person throwing a dumbbell that is made from two spherical masses connected by a rod, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 13. The dumbbell will rotate in a complex manner as it moves through the air. However, the centre of mass of the dumbbell will travel along a parabolic trajectory (projectile motion), because the only external force exerted on the dumbbell during its trajectory is gravity.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:The motion of the centre of mass of a dumbbell is described by Newton’s Second Law, even if the motion of the rotating dumbbell is more complex.\n\nIf we take the derivative with respect to time of the centre of mass position, we obtain the velocity of the centre of mass, and its components, which allow us to describe how the system is moving as a whole:\\vec v_{CM} &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec r_{CM} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec r_i=  \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i\\vec v_i\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore v_{CMx} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i v_{ix}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore v_{CMy} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i v_{iy}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore v_{CMz} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i v_{iz}\n\nNote that this is the same velocity that we found earlier for the velocity of the centre of mass frame of reference. In the centre of mass frame of reference, the total momentum of the system is zero. This makes sense, because the centre of mass represents the average position of the system; if we move “with the system”, then the system appears to have zero momentum.\n\nWe can also define the total momentum of the system, \\vec P, in terms of the total mass, M, of the system and the velocity of the centre of mass:\\vec P &= \\sum m_i \\vec v_i = \\frac{M}{M}\\sum m_i \\vec v_i\\\\\n&=M\\vec v_{CM}\n\nwhich we can also use in Newton’s Second Law:\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec P = \\sum \\vec F^{ext}\n\nand again, we see that the total momentum of the system is conserved if the net external force on the system is zero. In other words, the centre of mass of the system will move with constant velocity when momentum is conserved.\n\nFinally, we can also define the acceleration of the centre of mass by taking the time derivative of the velocity:\\vec a_{CM} &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec v_{CM} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec v_i=  \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i\\vec a_i\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore a_{CMx} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i a_{ix}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore a_{CMy} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i a_{iy}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore a_{CMz} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i a_{iz}\n\nExample 4.10\n\n\n\nFigure 14:A syzygy between the Sun, Earth, and Mars.\n\nIn astronomy, a syzygy is defined as the event in which three bodies are all lined up along a straight line. For example, a syzygy occurs when the Sun (mass M_S=2.00e30 {\\rm kg}), Earth (mass M_E=5.97e24 {\\rm kg}), and Mars (mass M_M=6.39e23 {\\rm kg}) are all lined up, as in \n\nFigure 14. How far from the centre of the Sun is the centre of mass of the Sun, Earth, Mars system during a syzygy?\n\nSolution\n\nSince this is a one-dimensional problem, we can define an x axis that is co-linear with the three bodies, and find only the x coordinate of the position of the centre of mass. We are free to choose the origin of the coordinate system, so we choose the origin to be located at the centre of the Sun. This way, the position of the centre of mass along the x axis will directly correspond to its distance from the centre of the Sun.\n\nThe Sun, Earth, and Mars are not point particles. However, because they are spherically symmetric, their centres of mass correspond to their geometric centres. We can thus model them as point particles with the mass of the body located at the corresponding geometric centre. If r_E=1.50e11 {\\rm m} (r_M=2.28e11 {\\rm m}) is the distance from the centre of the Earth (Mars) to the centre of the Sun, then the position of the centre of mass is given by:x_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i x_i\\\\\n&=\\frac{M_S(0)+M_Er_E+M_Mr_M}{M_S+M_E+M_M}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(2.00e30 {\\rm kg})(0)+(5.97e24 {\\rm kg})(1.50e11 {\\rm m})+(6.39e23 {\\rm kg})(2.28e11 {\\rm m})}{(2.00e30 {\\rm kg})+(5.97e24 {\\rm kg})+(6.39e23 {\\rm kg})}\\\\\n&=5.21e5 {\\rm m}\n\nThe centre of mass of the Sun-Earth-Mars system during a syzygy is located approximately 500 {\\rm km} from the centre of the Sun.\n\nDiscussion: The radius of the Sun is approximately 700000 {\\rm km}, so the centre of mass of the system is well inside of the Sun. The Sun is so much more massive than either of the Earth or Mars, that the two planets hardly contribute to shifting the centre of mass away from the centre of the Sun. We would generally consider the masses of the two planets to be negligible if one wanted to model how the solar system itself moves around the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nExample 4.11\n\n\n\nFigure 15:Three people on rafts on a lake.\n\nAlice (mass m_A), Brice (mass m_B), and Chloe (mass m_C) are stranded on individual rafts of negligible mass on a lake, off of the coast of Nyon. The rafts are located at the corners of a right-angle triangle, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 15, and are connected by ropes. The distance between Alice and Brice is r_{AB} and the distance between Alice and Chloe is r_{AC}, as illustrated. Alice decides to pull on the rope that connects her to Chloe, while Brice decide to pull on the rope that connects him to Alice. Where will the three rafts meet?\n\nSolution\n\nWe consider the system comprised of the three people and their rafts and model each person and their raft as a point particle with the mass concentrated at the centre of the raft. The forces exerted by pulling on the ropes are internal forces (one particle on the other), and will thus have no impact on the motion of the centre of mass of the system. There are no net external forces exerted on the system (the forces of gravity are balanced out by the forces of buoyancy from the rafts). The centre of mass of the system does not move when the people are pulling on the ropes, so they must ultimately meet at the centre of mass.\n\nWe can define a coordinate system such that the origin is located where Alice is initially located, the x axis is in the direction from Alice to Brice, and the y axis is in the direction from Alice to Chloe. The initial positions of Alice, Brice, and Chloe are thus:\\vec r_A &= 0\\hat x + 0\\hat y\\\\\n\\vec r_B &= r_{AB}\\hat x + 0\\hat y\\\\\n\\vec r_C &= 0\\hat x + r_{AC}\\hat y\n\nrespectively. The x and y coordinates of the centre of mass are thus:x_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i x_i = \\frac{m_A(0) + m_Br_{AB} + m_C(0)}{m_A + m_B + m_C}=\\left(\\frac{m_B}{m_A + m_B + m_C}\\right)r_{AB}\\\\\ny_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i m_i y_i = \\frac{m_A(0) + m_B(0) + m_Cr_{AC}}{m_A + m_B + m_C}=\\left(\\frac{m_C}{m_A + m_B + m_C}\\right)r_{AC}\\\\\n\nwhich corresponds to the position where the three rafts will meet, relative to the initial position of Alice.\n\nDiscussion: By using the centre of mass, we easily found where the three rafts would meet. If we had used Newton’s Second Law on the three rafts individually, the model would have been complicated by the fact that the forces exerted by Alice and Brice on the ropes change direction as the rafts begin to move, which would have required the use of integrals to determine the motion of each person.","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#the-centre-of-mass","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"The centre of mass for a continuous object","lvl2":"The centre of mass"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newmomentumandcm#the-centre-of-mass-for-a-continuous-object","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"The centre of mass for a continuous object","lvl2":"The centre of mass"},"content":"So far, we have considered the centre of mass for a system made of point particles. In this section, we show how one can determine the centre of mass for a “continuous object”. We previously argued that if an object is uniform and symmetric, its centre of mass will be located at the centre of the object. Let us show this explicitly for a uniform rod of total mass M and length L, as depicted in \n\nFigure 16.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:A rod of length L and mass M.\n\nIn order to determine the centre of mass of the rod, we first model the rod as being made of N small “mass elements” each of equal mass, \\Delta m, and of length \\Delta x, as shown in \n\nFigure 16. If we choose those mass elements to be small enough, we can model them as point particles, and use the same formulas as above to determine the centre of mass of the rod.\n\nWe define the x axis to be co-linear with the rod, such that the origin is located at one end of the rod. We can define the “linear mass density” of the rod, λ, as the mass per unit length of the rod:\\lambda = \\frac{M}{L}.\n\nA small mass element of length \\Delta x, will thus have a mass, \\Delta m, given by:\\Delta m = \\lambda \\Delta x\n\nIf there are N mass elements that make up the rod, the x position of the centre of mass of the rod is given by:x_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i^N m_i x_i = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i^N \\Delta m x_i \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i^N \\lambda \\Delta x x_i\\\\\n\nwhere x_i is the x coordinate of the i-th mass element. Of course, we can take the limit over which the length, \\Delta x, of each mass element goes to zero to obtain an integral:x_{CM} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_i^N \\lambda \\Delta x x_i = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L \\lambda x dx\n\nwhere the discrete variable x_i became the continuous variable x, and \\Delta x was replaced by dx (which is the same, but indicates that we are taking the limit of \\Delta x \\to 0). The integral is easily found:x_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L \\lambda x dx = \\frac{1}{M}\\lambda \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} x^2\\right]_0^L\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{M}\\lambda \\frac{1}{2} L^2 = \\frac{1}{M}\\left( \\frac{M}{L}\\right) \\frac{1}{2} L^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}L\n\nwhere we substituted the definition of λ back in to find, as expected, that the centre of mass of the rod is half its length away from one of the ends.\n\nSuppose that the rod was instead not uniform and that its linear density depended on the position x along the rod:\\lambda(x) = 2a + 3bx\n\nWe can still find the centre of mass by considering an infinitesimally small mass element of mass dm, and length dx. In terms of the linear mass density and length of the mass element, dx, the mass dm is given by:dm = \\lambda(x) dx\n\nThe x position of the centre of mass is thus found the same way as before, except that the linear mass density is now a function of x:x_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L \\lambda(x) x dx =\\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L (2a + 3bx) x dx=\\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L (2ax + 3bx^2) dx\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{M}  \\left[  ax^2 + bx^3  \\right]_0^L\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{M} (aL^2 + bL^3 )\n\nIn general, for a continuous object, the position of the centre of mass is given by:\\vec r_{CM} &=\\frac{1}{M}\\int \\vec r dm\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore x_{CM} &= \\frac{1}{M}\\int x dm\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore y_{CM} &=  \\frac{1}{M}\\int y dm\\nonumber\\\\\n\\therefore z_{CM} &=  \\frac{1}{M}\\int z dm\\\\\n\nwhere in general, one will need to write dm in terms of something that depends on position (or a constant) so that the integrals can be evaluated over the spatial coordinates (x,y,z) over the range that describe the object. In the above, we wrote dm = \\lambda dx to express the mass element in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nExample 4.12\n\n\n\nFigure 17:A symmetric bowl with parabolic sides is completely filled with water. The bowl has a height h.\n\nA bowl of height h has parabolic sides and a circular cross-section, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 17. The bowl is filled with water. The bowl itself has a negligible mass and thickness, so that the mass of the full bowl is dominated by the mass of the water. Where is the centre of mass of the full bowl?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can define a coordinate system such that the origin is located at the bottom of the bowl and the z axis corresponds to the axis of symmetry of the bowl. Because the bowl is full of water, and the bowl itself has negligible mass, we can model the full bowl as a uniform body of water with the same shape as the bowl and (volume) mass density ρ equal to the density of water. Furthermore, by symmetry, the centre of mass of the bowl will be on the z axis.\n\nBecause the bowl has a circular cross-section, we can divide it up into disk-shaped mass elements, dm, that have an infinitesimally small height dz, and a radius r(z), that depends on their z coordinate (\n\nFigure 17).\n\n\n\nFigure 18:The parabolic bowl divided up into disk-shaped mass elements, dm, that have an infinitesimally small height dz, and a radius r(z), that depends on their z coordinate.\n\nThe centre of mass of each disk-shaped mass element will be located where the corresponding disk intersects the z axis. The mass of one disk element is given by:dm = \\rho dV = \\rho \\pi r^2(z) dz\n\nwhere dV = \\pi r(z)^2 dz is the volume of the disk with radius r(z) and thickness dz. The radius of the infinitesimal disk depends on its z position, since the radii of the different disks must describe a parabola:z(r) &= \\frac{1}{a^2}r^2\\\\\nr(z) &= a\\sqrt z\\\\\n\\therefore dm &= \\rho \\pi r^2(z) dz= \\rho \\pi a^2  z dz\n\nwhere we introduced the constant a so that the dimensions are correct. The constant a determines how “steep” the parabolic sides are. The z coordinate of the centre of mass is thus given by:z_{CM} &=  \\frac{1}{M}\\int z dm =\\frac{1}{M}\\int_0^h z  (\\rho \\pi a^2 z dz)=\\frac{\\rho \\pi a^2}{M}\\int_0^h z^2dz \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\rho \\pi a^2}{M}\\left[ \\frac{1}{3}z^3 \\right]_0^h\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\rho \\pi a^2}{3M}h^3\n\nHowever, we are not quite done, since we do not know the total mass, M, of the water. To find the total mass of water, M, we proceed in an analogous way, and determine the value of the sum (integral) of all of the mass elements:M = \\int dm = \\int_0^h \\rho \\pi a^2 z dz = \\rho \\pi a^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}z^2 \\right]_0^h= \\frac{1}{2}\\rho \\pi a^2 h^2\n\nSubstituting this value for M, we can determine the z coordinate of the centre of mass of the full bowl:z_{CM} &=\\frac{\\rho \\pi a^2}{3M}h^3 = \\frac{2\\rho \\pi a^2}{3\\rho \\pi a^2 h^2}h^3=\\frac{2}{3}h\n\nRegardless of the actual shape of the parabola (the parameter a), the centre of mass will always be two thirds of the way up from the bottom of the bowl.\n\nDiscussion: In determining the centre of mass of a three dimensional object, we used symmetry to argue that the x and y coordinates would be zero. We then found the z position of the centre of mass by dividing up the bowl into infinitesimally small mass elements (disks) along the direction in which we needed to find the centre of mass coordinate.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nTrue or False: The centre of mass of a continuous object is always located within the object.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#the-centre-of-mass-for-a-continuous-object","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Circular Motion"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/newmomentumandcm#sec-momentumandcm-circularmotion","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Circular Motion"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/newmomentumandcm#sec-momentumandcm-circularmotion","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/newmomentumandcm#summary","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"The momentum vector, \\vec p, of a point particle of mass, m, with velocity, \\vec v, is defined as:\\vec p = m\\vec v\n\nWe can write Newton’s Second Law for a point particle in term of its momentum:\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec p = \\sum \\vec F = \\vec F^{net}\n\nwhere the net force on the particle determines the rate of change of its momentum. In particular, if there is no net force on a particle, its momentum will not change.\n\nThe net impulse vector, \\vec J^{net}, is defined as the net force exerted on a particle integrated from a time t_A to a time t_B:\\vec J^{net} = \\int_{t_A}^{tB} \\vec F^{net} dt\n\nThe net impulse vector is also equal to the change in momentum of the particle in that same period of time:\\vec J^{net} = \\Delta \\vec p = \\vec p_B - \\vec p_A\n\nWhen we define a system of particles, we can distinguish between internal and external forces. Internal forces are those forces exerted by the particles in the system on each other. External forces are those forces on the particles in the system that are not exerted by the particles on each other. The sum over all of the forces on all of the particles in the system will be equal to the sum over the external forces, because the sum over all internal forces on a system is always zero (Newton’s Third Law).\n\nThe total momentum of a system, \\vec P, is the sum of the momenta, \\vec p_i, of all of the particles in the system:\\vec P = \\sum \\vec p_i\n\nThe rate of change of the momentum of a system is equal to the sum of the external forces exerted on the system:\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec P = \\sum \\vec F^{ext}\n\nwhich can be thought of as an equivalent description as Newton’s Second Law, but for the system as a whole. If the net (external) force on a system is zero, then the total momentum of the system is conserved.\n\nCollisions are those events when the particles in a system interact (e.g. by colliding) and change their momenta. When modelling collisions, it is usually beneficial to first define a system for which the total momentum is conserved before and after the collision.\n\nCollisions can be elastic or inelastic. Elastic collisions are those where, in addition to the total momentum, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved. The total mechanical energy can usually be taken as the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles in the system.\n\nInelastic collisions are those in which the total mechanical energy of the system is not conserved. One can usually identify if mechanical energy was introduced or removed from the system and determine if the collision is elastic. It is important to identify when momentum and mechanical energy are conserved. Momentum is conserved if no net force is exerted on the system, whereas mechanical energy is conserved if no net work was done on the system by non-conservative forces (internal or external) or by external conservative forces.\n\nWe can always choose in which frame of reference to model a collision. In some cases, it is convenient to use the frame of reference of the centre of mass of the system, because in that frame of reference, the total momentum of the system is zero.\n\nIf a system has a total mass M, then one can use Newton’s Second Law to describe its motion:\\sum \\vec F^{ext} &= M \\vec a_{CM}\\\\\n\\sum \\vec F^{ext} &=\\frac{d}{dt} \\vec P\n\nwhere the sum of the forces is over all of the external forces on the system.

In general, any collision where two objects end up “stuck together” is inelastic.\n\nIn order to model the pendulum’s motion we first apply conservation of momentum to determine the speed, v', of the pendulum and embedded bullet just after the collision. Applying conservation of momentum in the x direction to the system formed by the pendulum and the bullet, just before and after the collision, we have:P &= mv\\\\\nP' &= (M+m)v'\\\\\n\\therefore mv &= (M+m)v'\\\\\n\\therefore v' &= \\frac{m}{m+M}v\n\nwhere P and P' are the initial and final momenta of the system, respectively. The pendulum with the bullet embedded in it will thus have a speed of v' at the bottom of the pendulum’s motion, before it swings upwards.\n\nWe can now use conservation of energy to model the swinging motion since, at that point, only tension and gravity act on the pendulum, and there are no non-conservative forces. If we choose the origin to be the location of the pendulum at the bottom of its trajectory, its initial gravitational potential energy is zero and its initial mechanical energy, E, is given by:E = \\frac{1}{2}(m+M) v'^2\n\nAt the top of the trajectory, the pendulum with the embedded bullet will stop and have no kinetic energy. The mechanical energy at the top of the trajectory, E', is thus equal to the gravitational potential energy of the pendulum at a height h above the origin:E' = (m+M)gh\n\nApplying conservation of mechanical energy allows us to find the initial speed of the bullet:E &= E'\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}(m+M) v'^2 &= (m+M)gh\\\\\nv'^2 &= 2gh\\\\\n\\left( \\frac{m}{m+M}v\\right)^2&= 2gh\\\\\n\\therefore v &= \\frac{m+M}{m} \\sqrt{2gh}\n\nwhere is the second last line we used the expression for v' that we obtained from conservation of momentum.\n\n**Discussion: **This example showed a situation in which momentum and energy were both conserved, but not at the same time. This example also highlighted how, by using conservation laws, one can derive models that are much easier to solve mathematically than if one had to model all of the forces involved.\n\nSolution 4.2\n\nThe collision is elastic because the energy used to compress the spring is “given back” when the spring extends again, since the spring force is conservative.\n\nThey key to modelling the compression of the spring is to identify the condition under which the spring is maximally compressed. This will occur at the point during the collision where the two masses will have exactly the same velocity, momentarily moving in unison as the spring is maximally compressed. Because, instantaneously, the masses have the same velocity, there is a frame of reference in which the two masses are at rest, and the momentum is zero. Of course, that frame of reference is the centre of mass frame of reference.\n\nBecause the collision is one-dimensional, we can calculate the velocity of the centre of mass as:v_{CM} = \\frac{Mv_M+mv_m}{m+M}\n\nwhere we note that v_m is a negative number, since the block of mass m is moving in the negative x direction. The total momentum, \\vec P^{CM}, in the centre of mass frame of reference must be zero. Writing this out for the x component and transforming the velocities of the two blocks into the centre of mass frame of reference:P^{CM}_x = M(v_M-v_{CM})+m(v_m-v_{CM})&=0\\\\\n\\therefore (v_m-v_{CM}) &= -\\frac{M}{m}(v_M-v_{CM})\n\nAlso note that we can write the velocity difference v_M-v_{CM} without using the centre of mass velocity:v_M-v_{CM} &= v_M-\\frac{Mv_M+mv_m}{m+M}=\\frac{1}{m+M}(v_M(m+M)-Mv_M-mv_m)\\\\\n&=\\frac{m}{m+M}(v_M-v_m)\n\nWe can then use conservation of energy in the centre of mass frame to determine the maximal compression of the spring. Before the collision, the total mechanical energy in the system, E, is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two blocks (as the spring is not compressed):E&=\\frac{1}{2}m(v_m-v_{CM})^2+\\frac{1}{2}M(v_M-v_{CM})^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{M^2}{m}(v_M-v_{CM})^2+\\frac{1}{2}M(v_M-v_{CM})^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}M \\left( 1 + \\frac{M}{m}\\right) (v_M-v_{CM})^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}M \\left(\\frac{m+M}{m} \\right)(v_M-v_{CM})^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}M \\left(\\frac{m+M}{m} \\right)\\left(\\frac{m}{m+M}(v_M-v_m)\\right)^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{mM}{m+M}\\right)(v_M-v_m)^2\n\nwhere we used our expressions above to simplify the expression. When the spring is maximally compressed, the two blocks are at rest and the mechanical energy of the system, E', is all “stored” as spring potential energy:E'&=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\nwhere x is the distance by which the spring is compressed. Equating the two allows us to determine the maximal compression of the spring:E &= E' \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{mM}{m+M}\\right)(v_M-v_m)^2 &= \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\\\\n\\therefore x &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{k} \\left(\\frac{mM}{m+M}\\right)}(v_M-v_m)\n\nDiscussion: By modelling the collision in the centre of mass frame of reference, we were easily able to determine the maximal compression of the spring. This would have been more difficult in the lab frame of reference, because the two blocks would still be moving when the spring is maximally compressed, so we would have needed to determine their speeds to determine the total mechanical energy when the spring is compressed.\n\nWhen we calculated the initial kinetic energy, we found that it was given by:E=\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{mM}{m+M}\\right)(v_M-v_m)^2 &=\\frac{1}{2}M_{red}(v_M-v_m)^2\n\nThe combination of masses in parentheses is called the “reduced mass” of the system, and is a sort of effective mass that can be used to model the system as a whole.\n\nSolution 4.3\n\nThe curved wire is illustrated in \n\nFigure 21, along with a small mass element, dm, on the wire, and our choice of coordinate system (centred at the centre of the semi-circle).

We can define the mass per unit length, λ, for the wire as:\\lambda =\\frac{M}{\\pi R}\n\nWe will choose to integrate the equation for the y position of the centre of mass over θ (from 0 to π), instead of over y, as it will make the integral easier (it is easier to express dm in terms of d\\theta than dy because the wire is curved). θ is the angle at which the mass element is located. The mass element forms an arc on the wire of length ds that subtends an angle d\\theta. The two are related by:ds = Rd\\theta\n\nThe mass element, dm, can then be expressed in terms of the mass per unit length of the wire and the length, Rd\\theta, of the mass element:dm = \\lambda ds = \\lambda Rd\\theta\n\nWe also need to express the y position of the mass element using θ:y = R\\sin\\theta\n\nNow that we have expressed dm and y in terms of θ, we can determine the y position of the centre of mass:y_{CM}  &= \\frac{1}{M}\\int y dm =  \\frac{1}{M}\\int_0^\\pi R\\sin\\theta \\lambda Rd\\theta\\\\\n&= \\frac{R^2\\lambda}{M}\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta = \\frac{R^2\\lambda}{M} \\bigl[-\\cos\\theta\\bigr]_0^\\pi\\\\\n&=\\frac{2R^2\\lambda}{M}=\\frac{2R}{\\pi}\n\nwhere in the last equality, we used the expression for the mass per unit length, λ, obtained above.\n\nNote that we are using primes (') to denote quantities in a different reference frame, not after a collision.\n\nIn reality, even atoms in a solid can move relative to each other, but they do not move by large amounts compared to the object.\n\nAgain, we are summing together forces that are acting on different particles.\n\nRecall, the internal forces are those forces that particles in the system are exerting on one another.

The first law is counter-intuitive, as our experience is that if you push a block on a table and let it go, it will eventually stop. Indeed, Aristotle proposed that the natural state of objects is to be at rest. As a result of Newton’s theory, we now understand that if you model a block sliding on a table, one must include a force of friction between the table and the block that acts to slow it down; a sliding block is thus not in a situation where no net external force is exerted on the object.\n\nNewton’s First Law is useful in defining what we call an “inertial frame of reference”, which is a frame of reference in which Newton’s First Law holds true. A frame of reference can be thought of as a coordinate system which can be moving. For example, if a train is moving with constant velocity, we can consider the train as an inertial frame of reference since objects in the train would follow Newton’s First Law for observers that are in the train. If a train passenger placed an object on a table, they would observe that the object does not spontaneously start moving; if they slide an object on a frictionless table, they would observe that it keeps on sliding at constant velocity.\n\nHowever, if the train is accelerating forwards, then an object placed on a frictionless table would appear, for observers in the train’s frame of reference, to be accelerating in the direction opposite to that of the train, and violate Newton’s First Law. An accelerating train is thus not an inertial frame of reference. To an observer on the ground, looking into the accelerating train through a window, the object placed on the table would appear to move with the same constant velocity as when it was placed on the table (the velocity of the train at the instant the object is placed on the table). In a similar way, when you are in a car, Newton’s First Law holds if the car is going at constant velocity, but if the car goes around a curve (and thus accelerates even its speed is constant), you will find that all objects in the car suddenly appear to be pushed towards the outside of the curve, in conflict with Newton’s First Law; this is because the accelerating car is not an inertial frame of reference and Newton’s First Law is thus not expected to hold.\n\nNewton’s First Law thus allows us to define an inertial frame of reference; Newton’s Three Laws only hold in inertial frames of reference.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nYou are in an elevator accelerating upwards.\n\nThe elevator is an inertial frame of reference.\n\nThe elevator is not an inertial frame of reference.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#newtons-first-law","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Newton’s Second Law","lvl2":"Newton’s Three Laws"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newtonslaws#newtons-second-law","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Newton’s Second Law","lvl2":"Newton’s Three Laws"},"content":"Newton’s Second Law is often written as a vector equation:\\sum \\vec F = m\\vec a\n\nwhere \\sum \\vec F is the vector sum of the forces exerted on an object, \\vec a is the acceleration vector of the object, and m is the “inertial mass” of the object. As we will see, a force is represented by a vector, and the sum of the force vectors on an object is often called the “net force”. Recall that using vectors to write an equation is just a shorthand for writing the equation out for each component. In three dimensions, this would thus correspond to three independent scalar equations (one for each component of the force and acceleration vectors):\\sum F_x &= ma_x \\\\\n\\sum F_y &= ma_y \\\\\n\\sum F_z &= ma_z\n\nNewton’s Second Law is the foundation for Classical Physics, in which we seek to quantitatively describe the motion of any object. The motion of an object is fully specified by its acceleration as long as we know the position and velocity at a specific point in time. That is, by knowing the position and velocity of the object at a point in time and its acceleration, we can describe its motion both in the future and in the in past; we call Classical Physics a deterministic theory (as opposed to, say, Quantum Mechanics, which would only tell us the probability that a particle would be at some particular position in the future). The right-hand side of Newton’s Second Law thus contains the kinematic description of the object; if we know the acceleration, we know everything about the motion of the object.\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation contains all of the “dynamics” to describe the object; force is the tool that Newton introduced in order to be able to determine the acceleration of an object. Newton’s Second Law thus tells how to determine the kinematics of an object by using the concept of forces; it relates the dynamics to the kinematics. Having already covered kinematics, we will now focus on understanding dynamics and how to develop models that allow us to calculate the net force on an object. The inertial mass, m, is a specific property of an object that tells us how large an acceleration it will experience based on a given net force.

Sometimes, the forces are called “action” and “reaction” forces, although this is misleading, because it makes it sound like the reaction force is “in response to” some voluntary action force. However, inanimate objects can exert forces, and so this can lead to needless confusion as to which force is the reaction force.\n\nIt does not matter which force you choose to call the action (reaction) force. If a block is pushing down on a table (action force), then the table is pushing up on the block (reaction force). However, one could just as well say that the table is pushing up on the block (action force) so the block is pushing down on the table (reaction force). It does not matter which force you call the action force. This can be confusing, because if you choose to push on a wall (exerting an action force), then the wall exerts a force on you (the reaction force). If you choose not to push on the wall (exerting no force), then the wall does not exert the reaction force. This leads to people thinking that the reaction force is in response to an action force exerted by a sentient being, which is not the case.

A force is not a real “thing”; there are no forces in the real world, you cannot give someone a force, or buy a force at the supermarket. A force is a purely mathematical tool, so it is important to fight your intuition about what a force is and to stick to well-defined rules for identifying forces to build models.\n\nMathematically, a force is represented by a vector, and thus has a magnitude and a direction. The SI unit for the magnitude of a force is the “Newton”, abbreviated, {\\rm N}. A force is used to describe how the motion of an object is affected by external agents. It is important to note that a force can be exerted by an inanimate being; that is, there is no intent - no conscious decision to push or pull - associated with a force.\n\nWhen you push a block along a horizontal surface, we would model the motion of the block as being related to a force that you exert on the block in the direction that you are pushing and with a magnitude that is proportional to how hard you are pushing. Newton’s Third Law states that the block will exert a force on you that is of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction; if we want to model your motion, we will need to include that force exerted by the block on you.\n\nIf you are pulling on a cart, we would model the motion of the cart by including a force that is exerted on the cart by you. The force would be represented by a vector in the direction that you are pulling with a magnitude based on how hard you are pulling. Similarly, to model your motion, we would include a force vector that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to represent the force exerted by the cart on you. When modelling the motion of an object, it is important to consider only the forces exerted on that object.\n\nOne way to quantify a force is to use a spring scale. Springs have a natural “rest length” if not acted upon by external forces. If you try to stretch a spring, it will “want” to come back to its normal rest length; it exerts a force on your hand in the opposite direction from the one you are pulling on the spring. You may have noticed that the more you stretch a spring, the harder you have to pull on it. We can quantify the magnitude of a force by the distance that the forces causes a spring to stretch, since that distance increases with what we conceptualize as a force. For example, one could designate a “standard spring” to be one that extends (or compresses) by 1 {\\rm cm} when a force of 1 {\\rm N} is exerted on the spring in the direction co-linear with the axis of the spring. We could then use that “standard spring” to measure the magnitude of any force.","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#force","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newtonslaws#sec-newtonslaws-typesofforces","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"content":"When modelling the dynamics of an object, we need to identify all of the forces exerted on that object.

In reality, contact forces arise because the electrons from two objects repel each other.

While all objects with mass exert an attractive force of gravity on all other objects with mass, that force is usually negligible unless the mass of one of the objects is very large. For an object near the surface of the Earth, we can, to a very good degree of approximation, assume that the only force of gravity on the object is from the Earth. We usually label the force of gravity on an object as \\vec F_g. All objects near the surface of the Earth will experience a weight, as long as they have a mass. If an object has a mass, m, and is located near the surface of the Earth, it will experience a force (its weight) that is given by:\\vec F_g = m\\vec g\n\nwhere \\vec g is the Earth’s “gravitational field” vector and points towards the centre of the Earth. Near the surface of the Earth, the magnitude of the gravitational field is approximately g=9.8 {\\rm N/kg}. The gravitational field is a measure of the strength of the force of gravity from the Earth (it is the gravitational force per unit mass). The magnitude of the gravitational field is weaker as you move further from the centre of the Earth (e.g. at the top of a mountain, or in Earth’s orbit). The gravitational field is also different on different planets; for example, at the surface of the moon, it is approximately g_m=1.62 {\\rm N/kg} (six times less) - thus the weight of an object is six times less at the surface of the moon (but its mass is still the same). As we will see, the magnitude of the gravitational field from any spherical body of mass M (e.g a planet) is given by:g(r) = G\\frac{M}{r^2}\n\nwhere G=6.67e-11 {\\rm } is Newton’s constant of gravity, and r is the distance from the centre of the object.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:The weight force on an object near the surface of the Earth points towards the centre of the Earth (downwards).\n\nAlthough we have not yet introduced the concept of mass, it is worth emphasizing that mass and weight are different (they have different dimensions). Mass is an intrinsic property of an object, whereas weight is a force of gravity that is exerted on that object because it has mass and is located next to another object with mass (e.g. the Earth). On Earth, when we measure our weight, we usually do so by standing on a spring scale, which is designed to measure a force by compressing a spring. We are thus measuring mg, which can easily be related to our mass since, on Earth, weight and mass are related by a factor of g=9.8 {\\rm N/kg}; this is usually what leads to the confusion between mass and weight.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA person standing on a scale finds that they weigh 80 {\\rm kg}.\n\nThey exert an upwards force on the Earth with a magnitude of 80 {\\rm N}.\n\nThey exert an upwards force on the Earth with a magnitude of 784 {\\rm N}.\n\nThey exert an downwards force on the Earth with a magnitude of 80 {\\rm N}.\n\nThey exert an downwards force on the Earth with a magnitude of 784 {\\rm N}.\n\nThey exert no force on the Earth.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#weight","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Normal forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/newtonslaws#normal-forces","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Normal forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"content":"Normal forces are exerted when two surfaces are in contact and “pushing” against each other. For example, if a block is resting on a horizontal table, the table will exert a normal force on the block that is upwards. The force is called “normal” because it is normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the interface between the two objects. The normal force exerted by a surface onto an object points in the direction from the surface to the object in such a way that it is perpendicular to the interface between the surface and the object. Because of Newton’s Third Law, whenever an object experiences a normal force from a surface, the object also exerts a force of the same magnitude (in the opposite direction) on the surface. The magnitude of the normal force exerted by a surface onto an object, in general, depends on the other forces that are exerted on the object. For example, if a block is on a table, it will experience a stronger normal force if you exert a downwards force on the block.\n\nFigure 2 shows two examples of the normal force on a block that is exerted by a surface (it is explicitly assumed that the block also experiences a downwards force from gravity that is not shown). In both cases, the normal force, \\vec N, is perpendicular to the interface and in the direction that goes from the interface towards the object.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:The normal force, \\vec N, exerted by a horizontal surface on a block (left side) and by an inclined surface (right side).

A frictional force is used to model the resistance that is felt when one tries to slide an object along a surface. The frictional force is used to model the details of how two surfaces interact at a microscopic level; since surfaces are never perfectly flat, two surfaces will never slide without resistance as the various bumps and valleys of the two surfaces will interact (\n\nFigure 3). Furthermore, even if the two surfaces were perfectly smooth, the electrons on the two surfaces would still interact and lead to an effective force when one surface moves with respect to the other.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Illustration that the frictional force between surfaces can be thought of as arising from microscopic imperfection in the surfaces, although even two perfectly smooth surfaces would still interact.\n\nOne distinguishes between two types of frictional forces: kinetic and static, depending on whether the surfaces are sliding with respect to each other (kinetic) or not (static). Because of Newton’s Third Law, the objects associated with each surface will both experience a frictional force (same magnitude, opposite direction).\n\nThe frictional force exerted on an object is always parallel to the surface of the object. For the kinetic force of friction, the force is exerted in the direction that is opposite to the motion of the object relative to the surface. For the static force of friction, the force is exerted in the direction that is opposite to the impeding motion. If a block is sliding towards the right on a table (\n\nFigure 4, left), it will experience a kinetic force of friction that is to the left. The table will then experience a force of friction that is to the right (Newton’s Third Law). If there is a heavy crate on the ground which you try to push but does not move (\n\nFigure 4, right), there is a force of static friction exerted by the ground on the object that is in the opposite direction that you are pushing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:(Left:) A block sliding to the right on a horizontal surface (not shown). The force of kinetic friction, \\vec f_k, is always perpendicular to the normal force and opposite of the direction of motion. (Right:) A block that is being acted upon by an external force \\vec F to the right. A force of static friction, \\vec f_s, is perpendicular to the normal force and opposite the direction of “impeding motion” - without the force of static friction, the block would start to accelerate towards the right, so the force of static friction is to the left.\n\nOne key difference between the forces of static and kinetic friction is that the magnitude of the force of static friction can vary in magnitude; the force of static friction on the crate increases as you push harder, until you push hard enough to overcome the maximal force of static friction that can exist between the ground and the crate. Often, the force of kinetic friction is smaller than the static force of friction; you may have noticed that you have to push very hard to get an object sliding, but once it is sliding, you do not need to push as hard to keep it moving.\n\nThe magnitude of the kinetic force of friction between two surfaces, f_k, is modelled as being proportional to the normal force between the two surfaces:f_k=\\mu_kN\n\nwhere \\mu_k is called the “coefficient of kinetic friction” and depends on the two surfaces. If you push down on an object, it is more difficult to slide it along a surface, because the normal force, and thus the kinetic friction force increases.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum magnitude of the force of static friction between two surfaces, f_s, is modelled as:f_s\\leq\\mu_sN\n\nwhere \\mu_s is called the “coefficient of static friction” and the inequality sign is used to indicate that the force of static friction has a maximum value, but that its magnitude depends on the other forces being exerted on the object. For example, if you do not push against a crate on a horizontal surface, there is no force of static friction on the crate (as long as no other forces are exerted that are parallel to the surface).","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#frictional-forces","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Tension forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/newtonslaws#tension-forces","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Tension forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"content":"Tension forces are “pulling” forces that are applied by a rope or other non rigid media (e.g. a chain) which cannot usually be used to push. If you attach a rope to a crate and use the rope to pull the crate, we call the force exerted by the rope onto the crate a force of tension.\n\nWhen you pull on a rope that is attached to a wall at the other end, we say that the rope is under tension, or that the tension force is present throughout the rope. If you pull really hard on the rope, it is harder to displace the centre of the rope (or any other point) than if you did not pull on the rope at all. It thus makes sense to view the tension as being present throughout the rope. The force of tension that a rope can apply onto an object depends on what is pulling on the rope at the other end. A rope can be used to change the direction of a force, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 5, which shows a pulley and rope being used to lift a block vertically by applying a horizontal force, \\vec F, to the rope.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:A force \\vec F is applied to a rope, which goes around a pulley and is attached to a crate. The rope exerts a force of tension \\vec T on the crate. If the pulley and rope are massless, then the magnitude of the applied force is equal to that of the tension force, and the rope and pulley effectively allow one to change the direction of the applied force vector.\n\nThe same tension is present throughout sections of the rope that can move freely. Imagine a rope lying on the ground and someone pressing down with their foot on the rope at its midpoint. If you pull on one end of the rope with your hand, there will be a tension in the section of the rope between your hand and the foot that is pressing on the rope, but the other side of the rope will be slack; the tension is thus different in different sections of the rope. As we will see in later chapters, if a rope goes around a pulley that is accelerating and has mass, then the tension in the rope on either side of the pulley is different; this is similar to the tension being different on either side of the foot pressing down on the rope.","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#tension-forces","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Drag forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/newtonslaws#drag-forces","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Drag forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"content":"Drag forces are exerted on an object that is moving through a fluid (a gas or a liquid). As an object moves through a fluid, the fluid must be displaced which results in a net force opposing the motion of the object. Drag forces are thus always in the opposite direction of the motion of the object relative to the fluid, similar to friction. Often, one hears the term “air friction” which refers to the drag force experienced by an object that is moving through the air.\n\nThere is no good general model for calculating the magnitude of the drag force on any object moving through any fluid. This usually has to be measured; while good software exist for simulating drag, you will still ultimately need to test your new airplane design in a wind tunnel to measure the drag force.\n\nThe magnitude of the drag force generally depends on the cross-section of the object (the area of the object as seen when looking at the object in the direction of motion), the speed of the object, and the visocity of the fluid (how difficult it is to displace the fluid). For small objects moving relatively slowly through a fluid (e.g. pollen falling through the air), the drag force is usually proportional to the object’s speed, whereas for larger objects moving faster through a fluid (e.g a car or airplane moving through the air) the drag force is usually proportional to the speed of the object squared.","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#drag-forces","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Spring forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/newtonslaws#spring-forces","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl4":"Spring forces","lvl3":"Types of forces","lvl2":"Force"},"content":"Spring forces are those forces that are exerted by those materials and objects that can be compressed or extended. A common example is a simple coil spring, which has a natural rest length. If the spring is extended, the spring will exert “restoring forces” on both ends of the spring that are directed towards the centre of the spring. If the spring is compressed, the spring will exert restoring forces that point away from the centre of the spring. In either case, the spring will exert forces that would allow it to come back to its rest length.\n\nMost springs, if they are not stretched or compressed too much, will exert a restoring force that is given by Hooke’s Law:\\vec F = -kx \\hat x\n\nwhere \\vec F is the force exerted by the spring, k is called the “spring constant” of the spring, and x is the amount that the spring has been stretched or compressed. The negative sign indicates that the restoring force from the spring will be in the opposite direction that the spring length was changed, and the x axis is defined to be co-linear with the axis of the spring and the origin is located where the spring is at rest.

In SI units, mass is measured in kilograms. One kilogram used to be defined to be the mass of a cylinder that is made of a platinum-iridium alloy that is kept at the international Bureau of Weights and Measures, in France. All other masses were obtained by comparison to this standard. In 2019, all base S.I. quantities (such as the kilogram) were redefined based on constants of nature (for example, the kilogram is now defined such that Planck’s constant has the exact value h=6.62607015e-34 {\\rm kg\\cdot m^2\\cdot s^{-1}}).\n\nNewton’s Second Law introduces the concept of mass as that property of the object that determines how large of an acceleration it will experience given a net force exerted on that object. In principle, one can compare the accelerations of different bodies to that of the international standard to determine their mass in kilograms. For example, under a given net force, if an object’s acceleration is half of that of the standard kilogram, the object has a mass of 2 {\\rm kg}.\n\nIn the context of Newton’s Second Law, mass is a measure of the inertia of an object; that is, it is a measure of how that particular object resists a change in motion due to a force (we can think of a large acceleration as a large change in motion, as the velocity vector of the object will change more). For this reason, the mass that appears in Newton’s Second Law is referred to as “inertial mass”.\n\nAs you recall, the weight of an object is given by the mass of the object multiplied by the strength of the gravitational field, \\vec g. There is no reason that the mass that is used to calculate weight, F_g=mg, has to be the same quantity as the mass that is used to calculate inertia F=ma. Thus, people will sometimes make the distinction between “gravitational mass” (the mass that you use to calculate weight and the force of gravity) and “inertial mass” as described above. Very precise experiments have been carried out to determine if the gravitational and inertial masses are equal. So far, experiments have been unable to detect any difference between the two quantities. As we will see, both Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity and Einstein Theory of General Relativity assume that the two are indeed equal. In fact, it is a key requirement for Einstein’s Theory that the two be equal (the assumption that they are equal is called the “Equivalence Principle”). You should however keep in mind that there is no physical reason that the two are the same, and that as far as we know, it is a coincidence!\n\nUnless stated otherwise, we will not make any distinction between gravitational and inertial mass and assume that they are equal.

The forces exerted on the top block are:\n\n\\vec F_g^m, its weight.\n\n\\vec N^m, a normal force from the wedge-shaped block.\n\n\\vec f_s^m, a force of static friction exerted by the wedge-shaped block.\n\nThe forces exerted on the wedge-shaped block are:\n\n\\vec F_g^M, its weight.\n\n\\vec N^M, a normal force exerted by the small block. Note that this force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to \\vec N^m (the two forces, \\vec N^m and \\vec N^M, which are on different objects, are an action/reaction pair of forces).\n\n\\vec f_s^M, a force of friction exerted by the small block (again, this forms an action/reaction pair of forces with  \\vec f_s^m).\n\nN_2^M, a normal force exerted by the table.\n\nThe forces for both blocks are shown in \n\nFigure 13.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:Forces on the block and the wedge-shaped block.","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#identifying-the-forces","position":57},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Free body diagrams","lvl2":"Applying Newton’s Laws"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newtonslaws#free-body-diagrams","position":58},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Free body diagrams","lvl2":"Applying Newton’s Laws"},"content":"In order to analyse the forces on an object more clearly, it is a very good idea to draw a “Free-Body Diagram” (FBD). A free-body diagram is simply a diagram where we draw the forces on a single object and represent the object as a point. Because the object is a point, we do not worry where on the object the forces are exerted. In later chapters, we will see that for extended bodies, it does matter where the forces are applied. However, Newton’s Laws as presented so far are only valid for objects that can be represented as a small point.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Free-body diagram for the block and the wedge-shaped block from \n\nExample 5.3.\n\nIn \n\nExample 5.3 above, we would draw one free-body diagram for each object (each mass), as shown in \n\nFigure 14.\n\nExample 5.4\n\n\n\nFigure 15:Two connected blocks sliding down an inclined plane.\n\nTwo blocks, of masses m_1 and m_2, are placed on an inclined plane that makes an angle θ with the horizontal. The blocks are connected by a massless string, as shown in \n\nFigure 15. The two blocks are sliding and accelerating downwards with an acceleration, \\vec a, as shown. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the plane and either block is \\mu_k. Draw a free-body diagram for each block.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we identify the forces on each mass (each block), which we then use to make the free-body diagram shown in \n\nFigure 16. On mass m_1, the forces are:\n\n\\vec F_{g1}, its weight.\n\n\\vec N_1, a normal force exerted by the inclined plane.\n\n\\vec f_{k1}, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the inclined plane. The force is in the opposite direction of the motion, and has a magnitude given by f_{k1}=\\mu_kN_1.\n\n\\vec T, a force of tension from the string.\n\nOn mass m_2, the forces are:\n\n\\vec F_{g2}, its weight.\n\n\\vec N_2, a normal force from the inclined plane.\n\n\\vec f_{k2}, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the inclined plane.

This is the same force as on m_1, but in the opposite direction. We chose to label the force as -\\vec T, instead of using a different variable, since it is just the negative of the vector that represents the tension force on m_1.\n\nIn \n\nFigure 16, we have shown the forces on each block using a free-body diagram. We also reproduced the vector for the acceleration (we drew the vector for the acceleration using a thicker arrow to indicate that it has a different dimension). We also reproduced the angle θ in the free-body diagram, as this is helpful once the free-body diagram is used with Newton’s Second Law.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Free-body diagram for the blocks m_1 and m_2 from \n\nFigure 15","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#free-body-diagrams","position":59},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Using Newton’s Second Law","lvl2":"Applying Newton’s Laws"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/newtonslaws#using-newtons-second-law","position":60},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Using Newton’s Second Law","lvl2":"Applying Newton’s Laws"},"content":"Applying Newton’s Second Law is straightforward once all of the forces exerted on an object have been identified. You should thus make sure that you spend most of your time drawing a good and complete free-body diagram before proceeding.\n\nNewton’s Second Law is a vector equation that relates the vector sum of all forces exerted on an object and the acceleration vector of the object. This corresponds to one scalar equation per component of the vector.\\sum \\vec F &=m\\vec a\\\\\n\\sum F_x &= ma_x \\\\\n\\sum F_y &= ma_y \\\\\n\\sum F_z &= ma_z\n\nIn order to use Newton’s Second Law, we thus need to introduce a coordinate system so that we can work with the components of the vectors (forces and acceleration) in that coordinate system. Usually, a good choice of coordinate system is one where the x (or y) axis is parallel to the acceleration vector. \n\nFigure 17 shows the free-body diagram from the m_1 block from the previous example (\n\nExample 5.4) along with a good choice of coordinate system.\n\n\n\nFigure 17:Free-body diagram and choice of coordinate system for the m_1 blocks from \n\nFigure 16\n\nTo apply Newton’s Second Law using the free-body diagram and coordinate system from \n\nFigure 17, we first write out all of the vector and then identify their x and y components. The force vectors are:\\vec T &= T\\hat x+0\\hat y\\\\\n\\vec f_{k1}&=-f_{k1}\\hat x+0\\hat y\\\\\n\\vec F_{g1}&=m_1g(\\sin\\theta \\hat x-\\cos\\theta \\hat y)\\\\\n\\vec N_1&=0\\hat x+N_1\\hat y\n\nWe can now write out the x component of Newton’s Second Law:\\sum F_x = T-f_{k1}+F_{g1}\\sin\\theta &= m_1 a\\\\\n\\therefore T-f_{k1}+F_{g1}\\sin\\theta &= m_1 a\n\nwhere we note that the normal force has no component in the x direction. The y component of Newton’s Second Law for mass m_1 is given by:\\sum F_y = N_1-F_{g1}\\cos\\theta&=0\\\\\n\\therefore N_1-F_{g1}\\cos\\theta&=0\n\nwhere we note that the forces of tension and friction have no y component. The two equations that we obtained above for x and y fully specify the motion of the m_1 block if all quantities are known.\n\nA few notes on applying Newton’s Second Law:\n\nWhen applying Newton’s Second Law, analyze each mass in the problem separately. It does not matter that block m_1 is connected by a rope to block m_2. Once you have determined all of the forces exerted on m_1, you can write Newton’s Second Law for m_1.\n\nNewton’s Second Law is a vector equation; this means that it is true for each (scalar) component of the vectors involved.\n\nYou can choose the coordinate system, so choose one that makes it easy to write out the vector components. A good choice is to choose x to be parallel to the acceleration vector, so that you do not have to break the acceleration vector up into components. The choice of coordinate system is only made in order to allow you to write out the components of Newton’s Second Law based on the free-body diagram.\n\nTreat each mass separately (since Newton’s Second Law is only true for an individual mass). This means that each mass will have its own free-body diagram and that you can choose the coordinate system that is most convenient for a given free-body diagram. In particular, this means that you do not need to choose the same coordinate system for different masses in a problem.\n\nThe following example shows how to write Newton’s Second Law for a system of two blocks.\n\nExample 5.5\n\n\n\nFigure 18:Two blocks connected by a massless string and massless pulley. Both blocks are accelerating.\n\nA block of mass m_1 is placed on an incline that makes an angle of θ with the horizontal. The block of mass m_1 is connected by a massless string through a massless pulley to a second block of mass m_2, which rests on a horizontal surface. The blocks are accelerating in such a way that the block of mass m_1 is accelerating down the incline, as shown in \n\nExample 5.5. The coefficient of kinetic friction between either block and the surface it is resting on is \\mu_k. Write Newton’s Second Law for both blocks.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we identify the forces on each mass (each block). On mass m_1, the forces are:\n\n\\vec F_{g1}, its weight.\n\n\\vec N_1, a normal force exerted by the inclined plane.\n\n\\vec f_{k1}, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the inclined plane. The force is in the opposite direction of the motion, and has a magnitude given by f_{k1}=\\mu_kN_1.\n\n\\vec T_1, a force of tension from the string.\n\nOn mass m_2, the forces are:\n\n\\vec F_{g2}, its weight.\n\n\\vec N_2, a normal force from the horizontal surface.\n\n\\vec f_{k2}, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the horizontal surface. The force is in the opposite direction of the motion, and has a magnitude given by f_{k2}=\\mu_kN_2.\n\n\\vec T_2, a force of tension from the string. This force has the same magnitude as the tension force \\vec T_1 exerted on mass m_1, because the pulley is massless.\n\nWe can then proceed to draw the free-body diagram for each mass, and use that to write out Newton’s Second Law. For mass m_1, the free-body diagram is shown in \n\nFigure 19. We have chosen a coordinate system that has the x axis parallel to the acceleration of the block, and the y axis upwards and perpendicular to the x axis, as shown.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:Free-body diagram for m_1.\n\nFor m_1, we can write Newton’s Second Law, starting with the x components:\\sum F_x = F_{g1}\\sin\\theta-f_{k1}-T_1&=m_1a_1\\\\\n\\therefore m_1 g\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k N_1 - T_1 &= m_1 a_1\n\nwhere, in the second line, we used the magnitude of the weight (F_{g1}=m_1g) and of the force of kinetic friction (f_{k1}=\\mu_kN_1). For the y component of Newton’s Second Law, in which the acceleration has no component, we have:\\sum F_y = N_1 - F_{g1}\\cos\\theta &= 0\\\\\n\\therefore N_1=m_1g\\cos\\theta\n\nwhich shows us that the magnitude of the normal force can easily be expressed in terms of the weight (F_{g1}=m_1g) and the angle of the incline.\n\nFor m_2, we can proceed in much the same way, choosing a different coordinate system, since the acceleration vector for m_2 points in a different direction (we don’t have to choose a different coordinate system, but we can if we find it makes things easier). The free-body diagram for m_2 is shown in \n\nFigure 20 along with our choice of coordinate system.\n\n\n\nFigure 20:Free-body diagram for m_2.\n\nWe start by writing out the x component of Newton’s Second Law for m_2:\\sum F_x = T_2 - f_{k2} &= m_2 a_2\\\\\n\\therefore T_2 - \\mu_k N_2 = m_2 a_2\n\nwhere again, we expressed the kinetic force of friction using the normal force and the coefficient of kinetic friction. The y component of Newton’s Second Law gives:\\sum F_y = N_2 - F_{g2} &=0\\\\\n\\therefore N_2 = m_2g\n\nwhere again, we expressed the weight in terms of the mass and g, and we find that the normal force has the same magnitude as the weight.\n\nNow that we have written Newton’s Second Law for each mass, we can write all four equations that we obtained to describe the system of two masses. We should also note that the magnitude of the tension forces are the same for the two masses (T_1=T_2=T), and that since the masses are connected by a string, the magnitude of their acceleration vectors are the same (a_1=a_2=a). Using this, we can describe the full system with the following 4 equations:m_1 g\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k N_1 - T &= m_1 a\\\\\nN_1=m_1g\\cos\\theta\\\\\nT - \\mu_k N_2 = m_2 a\\\\\nN_2 = m_2g\n\nOf the variables above (m_1, m_2, \\mu_k, T, N_1, N_2, a), one would only need to specify all but four of them to fully describe the motion of the system. For example, if one specifies the two masses and the coefficient of kinetic friction, all of the other variables can be determined.","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#using-newtons-second-law","position":61},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl2":"The acceleration due to gravity"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/newtonslaws#the-acceleration-due-to-gravity","position":62},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl2":"The acceleration due to gravity"},"content":"If you have studied some physics before reading this textbook, you may have been surprised by our choice of dimension for g to be force per unit mass rather than acceleration. This is indeed an unconventional choice as g is usually presented as “the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity” instead of the “strength of Earth’s gravitational field”. Our choice comes from the potential difference between inertial mass, m_I, and gravitational mass, m_G, which we distinguish in this section.\n\nConsider the simple model of a mass falling freely near the surface of the Earth in the absence of air-resistance. The only force exerted on the mass is its weight, m_G\\vec g, which is given in terms of gravitational mass (the mass that determines how an object experiences gravity). Both the weight and the acceleration of the object point downwards. The free-body diagram for the mass is shown in \n\nFigure 21, where the y axis was chosen to be vertically upwards (co-linear with the acceleration).\n\n\n\nFigure 21:Free-body diagram for a mass that is free-falling in the absence of air resistance (drag).\n\nWriting out the y component of Newton’s Second Law, being careful to distinguish between inertial and gravitational mass, and noting that both the weight and the acceleration are in the negative y direction:\\sum F_y = -F_g &= -m_I a\\\\\n\\therefore m_Gg &= m_I a\n\nThis makes it clear that g is not necessarily the acceleration due to gravity. It is only the acceleration due to gravity in the limit that the inertial and gravitational masses are the same. If m_G=m_I, then we have:a = g\n\nand indeed, the acceleration of objects near the surface of the Earth has a magnitude of g. It is also clear that the dimensions of g can also be written as an acceleration, and in most cases, one writes that, near the surface of the Earth, g=9.8 {\\rm m/s^2}. You should however remember that this is only true when inertial and gravitational masses are the same, and that g really should be thought of as the strength of the gravitational field, not as an acceleration.","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#the-acceleration-due-to-gravity","position":63},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Non-inertial frames of reference and inertial forces"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/newtonslaws#sec-newtonslaws-inertialforces","position":64},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Non-inertial frames of reference and inertial forces"},"content":"In the previous sections, we described how to use Newton’s First Law to identify an inertial frame of reference (one where Newton’s First Law holds true) in order to identify the forces exerted on an object so that Newton’s Second Law could be applied. It is possible to apply Newton’s Laws in a non-inertial frame of reference, provided that one includes an additional “inertial force”.\n\nLet us assume that we hang a mass, m, from the ceiling of our car using a string. If the car accelerates forwards with a constant acceleration, \\vec a, the mass will swing towards the back of the car and the string will not be vertical as long as the car maintains its constant acceleration, as shown in \n\nFigure 22. As the car maintains its acceleration, the hanging mass will not move relative to the car.\n\n\n\nFigure 22:A mass hanging from the ceiling of a car accelerating to the right.\n\nWe can analyse this motion from the inertial frame of reference of the ground. In this frame of reference, there are two forces exerted on the mass:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec T, a force of tension exerted by the string, in the direction of the string.\n\nThe two forces are shown in the free-body diagram of \n\nFigure 23, along with a coordinate system chosen such that x points in the direction of the acceleration the mass (which is the same as the acceleration of the car, since the mass does not move relative to the car).\n\n\n\nFigure 23:Free-body diagram for the forces acting on a mass suspended from the ceiling of accelerating car.\n\nWriting out the x and y components of Newton’s Second Law for the mass, we have:\\sum \\vec F &= \\vec T + \\vec F_g= m \\vec a\\\\\n\\therefore\\sum F_x &= T\\sin\\theta = ma\\\\\n\\therefore\\sum F_y &= T\\cos\\theta-F_g=0\n\nWe can, instead, model the motion of the mass in the frame of reference of the car, by pretending that we are sitting in the car. In the frame of reference of the car, the mass is immobile, and thus has no acceleration. In the non-inertial frame of reference of the car, we still have the weight and tension forces exerted on the mass; these have the same magnitude and direction as in the inertial frame of reference of the ground. One could replace the string with a spring scale, and observers in the car and on the ground would agree that the spring scale reads the same number. Those observers would also agree that the weight of the mass is the same. However, the two observers disagree on whether the mass is accelerating, since the observer in the car measures that the mass has no acceleration.\n\nIn the frame of reference of the car, the acceleration of the mass is zero. If we want Newton’s Second Law to hold, this implies that, in the reference frame of the car, the sum of the forces on the mass must be zero:\\sum \\vec F & = 0\\quad\\quad\\text{(car reference frame)}\n\nWe know from analysing the motion from the frame of reference of the ground that the vector sum of the forces \\vec T and \\vec F_g is equal to m\\vec a. The only way for the force in the frame of reference of the car to add up to zero is if there is an additional force, \\vec F_I, that is exerted in that frame of reference:\\sum \\vec F &= \\vec T + \\vec F_g + \\vec F_I =0\\quad\\quad\\text{(car reference frame)}\n\nSince we know that \\vec T + \\vec F_g=m\\vec a, we can substitute this in the equation above:\\sum \\vec F &= \\vec T + \\vec F_g + \\vec F_I =0\\quad\\quad\\text{(car reference frame)}\\\\\n&=m\\vec a+\\vec F_I = 0\\\\\n\\therefore F_I &= -m\\vec a\n\nand we find that this “inertial force”, \\vec F_I, must be exerted in the opposite direction from the acceleration of the frame of reference, with a magnitude given by ma. The free-body diagram for the mass, as viewed in the reference frame of the car, is illustrated in \n\nFigure 24.\n\n\n\nFigure 24:Free-body diagram for the forces acting on a mass suspended from the ceiling of accelerating car, in the frame of reference of the car. An additional inertial force, \\vec F_I=-m\\vec a, has to be included.\n\nExample 5.6\n\nYou are in an elevator that is accelerating downwards with a constant acceleration \\vec a. You are standing on a spring scale. What is the value of your weight as displayed on the spring scale? Assume that your mass is m. (The spring scale will display your weight as having the same magnitude as the normal force that the scale exerts on you).\n\nSolution\n\nWe can model your motion in the non-inertial frame of reference of the elevator, where your acceleration is zero. The forces that are exerted on you are:\n\n\\vec F_g, your weight, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, the normal force exerted upwards by the spring scale, which is the weight as measured by the scale.\n\n\\vec F_I, an inertial force with magnitude ma that is exerted upwards (in the direction opposite of the acceleration of the frame of reference).\n\nThe forces in the frame of reference of the elevator are illustrated in \n\nFigure 25, along with a coordinate system that was chosen so that the forces are co-linear with one of the axes (since the acceleration is zero).\n\n\n\nFigure 25:Free-body diagram for the forces exerted on a person as modelled in a frame of reference that is accelerating downwards.\n\nAll of the forces are in the vertical direction, so we only need to write out the y component of Newton’s Second Law, which we can easily solve for the normal force:\\sum F_y = N+F_I-F_g &=0\\\\\nN + ma -mg &=0\\\\\n\\therefore N=m(g-a)\n\nRemember that you need to be careful about the signs. We have included the fact that F_I is exerted upwards with the plus sign in the first equation (the y component of \\vec F_I=0\\hat x+F_I\\hat y is +F_I). We then used the fact that the magnitude of the inertial force is given by F_I=ma in the second line.\n\nYou can easily verify that you would obtain the same result in the inertial frame of reference of the ground, where there is no inertial force, but the acceleration is non-zero (and in the negative y direction if we use the same coordinate system):\\sum F_y =N-mg = -ma \\quad\\quad\\text{(ground frame of reference)}\n\nThe normal force, which corresponds to weight as read by the scale, is thus N=m(g-a). We should ask ourselves if the result makes sense:\n\nSince the dimension of a and g are the same, m(g-a) has the correct dimension of force.\n\nIf the acceleration, a, is zero, then the magnitude is N=mg, as it should be if the elevator is at rest with respect to the ground.\n\nIf the acceleration a is equal to g, the normal force exerted by the scale is exactly zero, and your measured weight is zero. This is what we call being “weightless”, which is not a good description, since the force of weight is still applied, and it is the normal force which is zero.\n\nIf the acceleration, a, is bigger than g, then the normal force would be negative. This corresponds to the elevator accelerating downwards faster than gravity, and the model breaks down, since in this case, you would first hit the ceiling of the elevator, which would then exert a downwards normal force with magnitude m(a+g).","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#sec-newtonslaws-inertialforces","position":65},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/newtonslaws#summary-4","position":66},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 5 - Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"Newton’s Three Laws are a theory of classical physics that allow the motion of an object to be fully described by introducing the concepts of force and mass.\n\nNewton’s First Law states that objects will not accelerate if no net force is exerted on the object. In particular, this allows inertial frames of reference to be defined as those frames of reference where Newton’s First Law holds true.\n\nNewton’s Second Law connects dynamics and kinematics by relating the net force exerted on an object (i.e. the vector sum of the forces exerted on an object) to its acceleration and its mass:\\vec F^{net} = \\sum_i \\vec F_i = m\\vec a\n\nNewton’s Third law states that forces always come in pairs that are exerted on different objects. If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts a force that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction on object A.\n\nA force is a mathematical tool introduced in Newton’s theory to model how different objects can influence each other. Mass can be thought of as a quantity of matter and is an intrinsic property of an object. Inertial mass refers to how that quantity of matter resists acceleration, whereas gravitational mass refers to how that quantity of mass experiences the force of gravity. As far as we can tell, inertial and gravitational mass are the same.\n\nWhen applying Newton’s theory, the most important part is to identify the forces that act on one object. This can be represented graphically by using a free-body diagram. The following is a common list of forces to consider when identifying the forces exerted on an object:\n\nWeight (is the object near the surface of a planet?).\n\nNormal forces (is the object in contact with any surface? There could be more than one!).\n\nFrictional forces (are there static or kinetic friction forces associated with the normal forces?).\n\nTension forces (is something like a rope pulling on the object?).\n\nDrag forces (is the object moving through a fluid?).\n\nSpring forces (is there a spring pushing or pulling on the object?).\n\nApplied forces (is anything else pushing or pulling on the object?).\n\nWhen applying Newton’s Second Law, one needs to choose a coordinate system so that Newton’s Second Law can be written out for each component. It is usually good to choose the coordinate system such that the x axis is parallel to the acceleration vector of the object.\n\nWhen using Newton’s Laws to model the motion of an object of mass m in a non-inertial frame of reference that is accelerating with acceleration \\vec a relative to an inertial frame of reference, an additional inertial force, \\vec F_I=-m\\vec a, must be included on the object.\n\nImportant Equations\n\nNewton’s Second Law, in vector form, can be written as:\\sum \\vec F = m\\vec a\n\nwhich is just a short-hand notation for the scalar equations written out for each component:\\sum F_x &= ma_x \\\\\n\\sum F_y &= ma_y \\\\\n\\sum F_z &= ma_z\n\nThe force of gravity (or weight), \\vec F_g, near the surface of the Earth is given by:\\vec F_g = m\\vec g\n\nwhere Earth’s gravitational field has a magnitude of g=9.8 {\\rm N/kg}.\n\nThe force of kinetic friction exerted by one surface on another is given by::f_k=\\mu_kN\n\nwhere N is the normal force between the two surfaces and \\mu_k is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

We know that Newton’s Second Law relates the forces on Katie to her acceleration. If we build a model of the forces on Katie, we can then determine her acceleration. Once we know her acceleration, we can use kinematics to determine how long it takes for her to cover the distance of 40 {\\rm m}.\n\nThe forces exerted on Katie are:\n\n\\vec F_g, her weight.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted by the slope.\n\n\\vec f_k, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the slope, with magnitude f_k=\\mu_kN\n\nThis allows us to build a free-body diagram for the forces on Katie, as shown in \n\nFigure 28. Since Katie will glide down the slope, her acceleration will be parallel to the slope and downwards, which we showed with a thicker arrow on the free-body diagram. Our free-body diagram also shows the coordinate system that we chose, with the x axis pointing parallel to the acceleration.\n\n\n\nFigure 28:Forces acting on Katie as she snowboards.\n\nWith a free-body diagram, we can write the x and y components of Newton’s Second Law. In the x direction, both the force of friction and the weight have components. The force of friction is in the negative x direction, whereas the component of gravity in the x direction is F_g\\sin\\theta. The acceleration vector is also in the x direction. Putting this altogether into Newton’s Second Law:\\sum F_x = F_g\\sin\\theta - f_k &= ma\\\\\n\\therefore mg\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k N &= ma\n\nwhere we used the fact that the weight is given by mg (m is Katie’s mass) and the magnitude of the force of friction is given by f_k=\\mu_kN.\n\nNext, we write out the y component of Newton’s Second Law. The normal force is in the positive y direction, whereas the component of gravity in the y direction is -F_g\\cos\\theta. The acceleration has no component in the y direction. Putting this into Newton’s Second Law:\\sum F_y = N-F_g\\cos\\theta &=0\\\\\n\\therefore N-mg\\cos\\theta &=0\n\nWe now have two equations that describe Katie’s motion:mg\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k N &= ma\\\\\nN-mg\\cos\\theta &=0\n\nWe have three unknowns, m, N, and a, but only two equations! Hopefully, one of these will cancel out! At this point, all of the physics for the problem is done! We can now proceed to solve these equations to find the acceleration. The second equation allows us to solve for the normal force, N=mg\\cos\\theta, which we substitute into the first equation:mg\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k N &= ma\\\\\n\\therefore mg\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k mg\\cos\\theta &= ma\\\\\n\nAs you can see, the mass m can be cancelled out of this equation, and we can find the acceleration:a&=g\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k g\\cos\\theta\\\\\n&=g(\\sin\\theta-\\mu_k\\cos\\theta)\\\\\n&=(9.8 {\\rm N/kg})\\left(\\sin(50 {\\rm \\degree})-(0.45)\\cos(50 {\\rm \\degree})\\right)\\\\\n&=4.67 {\\rm N/kg}\n\nAt this point, we should ask ourselves if our result makes sense. In particular, we have found that the acceleration has unit of {\\rm N/kg} instead of {\\rm m/s^2}. A quick examination of Newton’s Second Law shows us that these two units are equivalent:F &= ma\\\\\na &= \\frac{F}{m}\\\\\n\\therefore {\\rm [a]} &= \\frac{\\rm [F]}{\\rm [m]}=\\frac{\\rm N}{\\rm kg}\n\nOften, one write the magnitude of the Earth’s gravitation field as g=9.8 {\\rm m/s^2}, since it has the same dimension as acceleration, and does indeed correspond to the acceleration that is felt by falling objects near the surface of the Earth. In fact, g, is usually defined as the acceleration of object near the Earth, although this is misleading, as it requires that inertial and gravitational mass be the same.\n\nKnowing that Katie’s initial velocity is v_{0x}=0 {\\rm m/s}, her acceleration is a_x=a=4.67 {\\rm m/s^2} in the x direction (the same direction as the slope), and the distance that she must travel is x=40 {\\rm m}, we can find the time it takes for her to face-plant. If we set the origin of the x axis where she starts (so that her initial position along the x axis, x_0=0), the distance that she covered in the time, t, is given by:x(t)&=x_0+v_{0x}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^2\\\\\n40 {\\rm m}&=(0)+(0)t+\\frac{1}{2}(4.67 {\\rm m/s^2})t^2\\\\\n\\therefore t&=\\sqrt{\\frac{2(40 {\\rm m})}{(4.67 {\\rm m/s^2})}}=4.14 {\\rm s}\n\nKatie has 4.14 {\\rm s} of gliding bliss before face-planting into the large pile of snow.\n\nSolution 5.2\n\nThe only way for box 1 to accelerate is if box 2 “drags” box 1 along with it through a force of friction exerted at the interface between box 1 and box 2. We need to show that the force of (static) friction exerted by the ground on box 1 will always be at least as large as the force of friction exerted by box 2 on box 1. The largest force of friction that box 2 can exert on box 1 is a force of static friction, so we model all forces between surfaces as forces of static friction.\n\nThe forces on box 2 are:\n\n\\vec F_{2g}, its weight.\n\n\\vec N_2, a normal exerted by box 1.\n\n\\vec f_{2s}, a force of static friction exerted by box 1.\n\n\\vec F, the applied force.\n\nThe forces on box 1 are:\n\n\\vec F_{1g}, its weight.\n\n-\\vec N_2, a normal force exerted by box 2 (downwards).\n\n-\\vec f_{2s}, a force of static friction exerted by box 2.\n\n\\vec N_1, a normal force exerted by the ground.\n\n\\vec f_{1s}, a force of static friction exerted by the ground.\n\nThe are illustrated in the free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 29\n\n\n\nFigure 29:Forces on the two boxes.\n\nConsidering the y component of Newton’s Second Law for box 2 (the top box), we can find the value of the normal force exerted by box 1:\\sum F_y &= N_2 - F_{2g} = 0\\\\\n\\therefore N_2 &= m_2 g\n\nThe maximal magnitude of the force of static friction, f_{2s}, between the two boxes is given by:f_{2s} = \\mu_sN_2 = \\mu_s m_2g\n\nThis is the maximal magnitude of the force that can accelerate box 1. Considering the y component of Newton’s Second Law applied to box 1, we can find N_1, the normal force exerted by the ground:\\sum F_y = N_1 - F_{1g} - N_2 = 0\\\\\n\\therefore N_1 = F_{1g}+N_2 = (m_1+m_2)g\n\nThe force of static friction exerted by the ground on box 1 will be in the opposite direction as the force of static friction exerted by box 2. The maximal magnitude of the force of static friction exerted by the ground is given by:f_{1s} = \\mu_sN_1 = \\mu_s (m_1+m_2)g\n\nWe can see that the maximal force of static friction exerted by the ground will always exceed the magnitude of the force of static friction exerted by box 2. It is thus impossible to push on box 2 to make box 1 move (as long as the force of static friction between the two boxes and the box and the ground are the same).\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is impossible to ever touch anything, you can just get really close!\n\nIf you attached a rigid rod to an object and pulled on the rigid rod, you could call the force exerted by the rod on the object a force of tension, even if the rod is rigid.\n\nSince we have two equations, we technically only need to specify all but two quantities to be able to fully model the motion of the block.","type":"content","url":"/newtonslaws#solutions","position":75},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#chap-applyingnewtonslaws","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"In this chapter, we take a closer look at how to use Newton’s Laws to build models to describe motion.

In static situations, the acceleration of the object is zero. By Newton’s Second Law, this means that the vector sum of the forces (and torques, as we will see in a later chapter) exerted on an object must be zero. In dynamic situations, the acceleration of the object is non-zero.\n\nFor static problems, since the acceleration vector is zero, we can choose a coordinate system in a way that results in as many forces as possible being aligned with the axes (so that we minimize the number of forces that we need to break up into components).\n\nExample 6.1\n\nYou push horizontally with a force \\vec F on a box of mass m that is resting against a vertical wall, as shown in \n\nFigure 1. The coefficient of static friction between the wall and the box is \\mu_s. What is the minimum magnitude of the force that you must exert for the box to remain stationary?\n\n\n\nFigure 1:A horizontal force exerted on box that is resting against a wall.\n\nSolution\n\nSince the acceleration of the box is zero, the vector sum of the forces exerted on the box is zero. We start by identifying the forces exerted on the box; these are:\n\n\\vec F, the horizontal force that you exert on the box.\n\n\\vec F_g, the weight of the box, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted by the wall on the box. The force is in the horizontal direction, in the opposite direction to \\vec F.\n\n\\vec f_s, a vertical force of static friction between the wall and the box. The force points upwards as the “impeding motion” of the block is downwards. The force will have at most a magnitude of f_s\\leq\\mu_s N, since the force of static friction depends on the other forces exerted on the object.\n\nThe forces are shown in the free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 2, along with our choice of coordinate system which was chosen so that all forces are either in the x or y direction.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Free-body diagram of the forces exerted on the box.\n\nThe x component of Newton’s Second Law is:\\sum F_x = F - N &=0\\\\\n\\therefore N = F\n\nwhich tells us that the normal force exerted by the wall has the same magnitude as the applied force, \\vec F. The y component of Newton’s Second Law is:\\sum F_y = f_s - F_g &=0\\\\\n\\therefore f_s -mg &=0\\\\\n\\therefore f_s = mg\\\\\n\nwhich tells us that the force of friction must have the same magnitude as the weight. This makes sense, since they are the only forces with components in the y direction, and thus, they must cancel each other out.\n\nThe force of friction will be less than or equal to \\mu_sN, and thus less than or equal to \\mu_s F, since \\vec F and \\vec N have the same magnitude (from the x component of Newton’s Second Law). Furthermore, since f_s=mg, we can write:f_s &\\leq \\mu_s F\\\\\n\\therefore mg &\\leq \\mu_s F\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{mg}{\\mu_s} &\\leq F\n\nwhich gives us the condition that F\\geq mg/\\mu_s, and thus the minimum magnitude of F in order to keep the box from sliding down.\n\nAlthough we used the lesser than or equal to sign in the above equations, we could have used an equal sign if we were confident that the force of friction has its maximal magnitude, f_s=\\mu_sN. The maximal magnitude of the force of friction is proportional to the force that we exert (since N=F); if we want to exert the least amount of force F, then we need the force of friction to be equal to its maximal magnitude which needs to be equal to the weight of the box.\n\nDiscussion: This model for the minimal required force makes sense because:\n\nThe dimension of mg/\\mu_s is force.\n\nIf the mass of the box is increased, then one needs to push harder against the box to keep it up.\n\nIf the coefficient of static friction, \\mu_s, is increased, one does not need to push as hard.","type":"content","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#statics","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Linear motion"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#linear-motion","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Linear motion"},"content":"We can describe the motion of an object whose velocity vector does not continuously change direction as “linear” motion. For example, an object that moves along a straight line in a particular direction, then abruptly changes direction and continues to move in a straight line can be modelled as undergoing linear motion over two different segments (which we would model individually). An object moving around a circle, with its velocity vector continuously changing direction, would not be considered to be undergoing linear motion. For example, paths of objects undergoing linear and non-linear motion are illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:(Left:) Displacement vectors for an object undergoing three segments that can each be modelled as linear motion. (Right:) Path of an object whose velocity vector changes continuously and cannot be considered as linear motion.\n\nWhen an object undergoes linear motion, we always model the motion of the object over straight segments separately. Over one such segment, the acceleration vector will be co-linear with the displacement vector of the object (parallel or anti-parallel - note that the acceleration can change direction as it would from a spring force, but will always be co-linear with the displacement).\n\nExample 6.2\n\nA block of mass m is placed at rest on an incline that makes an angle θ with respect to the horizontal, as shown in \n\nFigure 4. The block is nudged slightly so that the force of static friction is overcome and the block starts to accelerate down the incline. At the bottom of the incline, the block slides on a horizontal surface.\n\nThe coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is \\mu_{k1}, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and horizontal surface is \\mu_{k2}. If one assumes that the block started at rest a distance L from the bottom of the incline, how far along the horizontal surface will the block slide before stopping?\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A block slides down an incline before sliding on a flat surface and stopping.\n\nSolution\n\nWe can identify that this is linear motion that we can break up into two segments: (1) the motion down the incline, and (2), the motion along the horizontal surface. We will thus identify the forces, draw the free-body diagram for the block, and use Newton’s Second Law twice, once for each segment.\n\nIt is often useful to describe the motion in words to help us identify the steps required in building a model for the block. In this case we could say that:\n\nThe block slides down the incline and accelerates in the direction of motion. By identifying the forces and applying Newton’s Second Law, we can determine its acceleration which will be parallel to the incline.\n\nThe block will reach a certain speed at the bottom of the incline, which we can determine from kinematics by knowing that the block travelled a distance L, with a known acceleration and that it started at rest.\n\nThe block will decelerate along the horizontal surface. Again, by identifying the forces and using Newton’s Second Law, we will be able to determine the acceleration of the block.\n\nThe block will stop after having travelled an unknown distance, which we can find by using kinematics and knowing the acceleration of the block as well as its initial velocity at the bottom of the incline.\n\nOur first step is thus to identify the forces on the block while it is on the incline. These are:\n\n\\vec F_{g}, its weight.\n\n\\vec N_1, a normal force exerted by the incline.\n\n\\vec f_{k1}, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the incline. The force is opposite of the direction of motion, and has a magnitude given by f_{k1}=\\mu_{k1}N_1.\n\nThese are shown on the free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 5. As usual, we drew the acceleration, \\vec a_1, on the free-body diagram, and chose the direction of the x axis to be parallel to the acceleration.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Free-body diagram for the block when it is on the incline.\n\nWriting out the x component of Newton’s Second Law, and using the fact that the acceleration is in the x direction (\\vec a=a_1\\hat x):\\sum F_x = F_g\\sin\\theta - f_{k1} &= ma_1\\\\\n\\therefore mg\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{k1} N_1 &= ma_1\n\nwhere we expressed the magnitude of the kinetic force of friction in terms of the normal force exerted by the plane, and the weight in terms of the mass and gravitational field, g. The y component of Newton’s Second Law can be written:\\sum F_y = N_1-F_g\\cos\\theta &= 0\\\\\n\\therefore N_1 = mg\\cos\\theta\n\nwhich we used to express the normal force in terms of the weight. We can use this expression for the normal force by substituting it into the equation we obtained from the x component to find the acceleration along the incline:mg\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{k1} N_1 &= ma_1\\\\\nmg\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{k1} mg\\cos\\theta&= ma_1\\\\\n\\therefore a_1 &= g(\\sin\\theta-\\mu_{k1}\\cos\\theta)\n\nNow that we know the acceleration down the incline, we can easily find the velocity at the bottom of the incline using kinematics. We choose the origin of the x axis to be zero where the block started (x_0=0), so that the block is at position x=L at the bottom of the incline. Using kinematics, we can find the speed, v, given that the initial speed, v_0=0:v^2-v_0^2&=2a_1(x-x_0)\\\\\nv^2&=2a_1L\\\\\n\\therefore v &= \\sqrt{2a_1L}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{2Lg(\\sin\\theta-\\mu_{k1}\\cos\\theta)}\n\nWe can now proceed to build a model for the second segment. We first identify the forces on the block when it is on the horizontal surface; these are:\n\n\\vec F_{g1}, its weight.\n\n\\vec N_2, a normal force exerted by the horizontal surface. This is in general different than the normal force exerted when the block was on the inclined plane.\n\n\\vec f_{k2}, a force of kinetic friction exerted by the horizontal surface. The force is opposite of the direction of motion, and has a magnitude given by f_{k2}=\\mu_{k2}N_2.\n\nThe forces are illustrated by the free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 6, where we showed the acceleration vector, \\vec a_2, which we determined to be to the left since the block is decelerating. We also chose an xy coordinate system such that the x axis is anti-parallel to the acceleration, so that the motion is in the positive x direction (and the acceleration in the negative x direction).\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Free-body diagram for the block when it is sliding along the horizontal surface. We (arbitrarily) chose the positive x direction to be in the direction of motion and anti-parallel to the acceleration. We could easily have chosen the opposite direction.\n\nWriting out the x component of Newton’s Second Law:\\sum F_x = -f_{k2} &= -ma_2\\\\\n\\therefore \\mu_{k2}N_2 &= ma_2\n\nwhere we expressed the force of kinetic friction using the normal force. We  have to be careful here with the sign of the acceleration; the equation that we wrote implies that a_2 is a positive number, since \\mu_{k2} is positive and N_2 is also positive (it is the magnitude of the normal force). a_2 is the magnitude of the acceleration, and we included the fact that the acceleration points in the negative x direction when we put a negative sign in the first line. The x component of the acceleration is -a_2, and the vector is given by \\vec a_2=-a_2\\hat x.\n\nThe y component of Newton’s Second Law will allow us to find the normal force:\\sum F_y = N_2 -F_g &=0\\\\\n\\therefore N_2 = mg\n\nwhich we can substitute back into the x equation to find the magnitude of the acceleration along the horizontal surface:ma_2 &=\\mu_{k2}N_2 \\\\\n\\therefore a_2&=\\mu_{k2}g\n\nNow that we have found the acceleration along the horizontal surface, we can use kinematics to find the distance that the block travelled before stopping. We choose the origin of the x axis to be the bottom of the incline (x_0=0), the acceleration is negative a_x = -a_2 = -mu_{k2}g, the final speed is zero, v=0, and the initial speed, v_0 is given by our model for the first segment. Using one of the kinematic equations:v^2-v_0^2&=2(-a_2)(x-x_0)\\\\\nv_0^2&=2a_2x\\\\\n\\therefore x &=\\frac{1}{2a_2}v_0^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2\\mu_{k2}g}2Lg(\\sin\\theta-\\mu_{k1}\\cos\\theta)\\\\\n\\therefore x&=\\frac{(\\sin\\theta-\\mu_{k1}\\cos\\theta)}{\\mu_{k2}}L\n\nDiscussion: The model for the distance x that it takes the block to stop makes sense because:\n\nAll of the terms in the fraction are dimensionless, so the value of x will have the same dimension as L.\n\nIf we make L bigger, then x will be bigger (if we release the block from higher up on the incline, it will have more time to accelerate and will slide further before stopping).\n\nIf we make \\mu_{k1} bigger, then x will be smaller: if we increase friction on the incline, the block will have a smaller acceleration and smaller speed at the bottom.\n\nIf we increase the friction with the horizontal plane (increase \\mu_{k2}), then x will be reduced (it won’t slide as far if there is more friction on the horizontal plane).\n\nIf we increase θ, the numerator will be larger, so x will increase (the block will accelerate more down a steeper incline and end up further).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA present is placed at rest on a plane that is inclined, at a distance L from the bottom of the incline, much like the box in \n\nExample 6.2 above. At the bottom of the incline, the box is determined to have a speed v. If the box is instead released from a distance of 4L from the bottom of the incline, what will its speed at the bottom of the incline be?\n\nv\n\n2v\n\n4v\n\nit depends on the coefficient of friction between the present and the plane.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#linear-motion","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Modelling situations where forces change magnitude","lvl2":"Linear motion"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#sec-applyingnewtonslaws-modellingwhereforcechanges","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Modelling situations where forces change magnitude","lvl2":"Linear motion"},"content":"So far, the models that we have considered involved forces that remained constant in magnitude.

In these case, even if the object undergoes linear motion, we need to break up the motion into many small segments over which we can assume that the forces are constant. If the forces change continuously, we will need to break up the motion into an infinite number of segments and use calculus.\n\nConsider the block of mass m that is shown in \n\nFigure 7, which is sliding along a frictionless horizontal surface and has a  horizontal force \\vec F(x) exerted on it.

The x component of Newton’s Second Law gives the acceleration:\\sum F_x = F_i = ma_i\n\nwhere we have used the index i to indicate which segment the block is in (i can be 1, 2 or 3). The acceleration of the block in segment i is given by:a_i = \\frac{F_i}{m}\n\nIf the speed of the block is v_0 at the beginning of segment 1 (x=x_0), we can find its speed at the end of segment 1 (x=x_1), v_1, using kinematics and the fact that the acceleration in segment 1 is a_1:v_1^2-v_0^2 &= 2a_1(x_1 - x_0)\\\\\nv_1^2 &=v_0^2+ 2a_1\\Delta x\\\\\n\\therefore v_1^2 &=v_0^2+2\\frac{F_1}{m}\\Delta x\n\nWe can now easily find the speed at the end of segment 2 (x=x_2), v_2, since we know the speed at the beginning of segment 2 (x_1,v_1) and the acceleration a_2:v_2^2 -v_1^2 &= 2a_2(x_2 - x_1)\\\\\n\\therefore v_2^2 &= v_1^2 + 2a_2\\Delta x\\\\\n&=v_0^2+ 2\\frac{F_1}{m}\\Delta x + 2\\frac{F_2}{m}\\Delta x\n\nIt is easy to show that the speed at the end of the third segment is:v_3^2 = v_0^2+ 2\\frac{F_1}{m}\\Delta x + 2\\frac{F_2}{m}\\Delta x +2\\frac{F_3}{m}\\Delta x\n\nIf there were N segments, with the force being different in each segment, we could use the summation notation to write:v_N^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \\frac{F_i}{m}\\Delta x\n\nFinally, if the magnitude of the force varied continuously as a function of x, \\vec F(x), we would model this by taking segments whose length, \\Delta x, tends to zero (and we would need an infinite number of such segments). For example, if we wanted to know the speed of the object at position x=X along the x axis, with a force that was given by \\vec F(x)=F(x)\\hat x, if the object started at position x_0 with speed v_0, we would take the following limit:v^2 = v_0^2 + \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} 2\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \\frac{F(x)}{m}\\Delta x\n\nwhere \\Delta x = \\frac{X}{N} so that as \\Delta x\\to 0, N\\to\\infty. Of course, integrals are the exact tool that allow us to evaluate the sum in this limit:\\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} 2\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \\frac{F_i}{m}\\Delta x =2 \\int_{x_0}^{X}\\frac{F(x)}{m}dx\n\nand the speed at position x=X is given by:v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 \\int_{x_0}^{X}\\frac{F(x)}{m}dx\n\nNaturally, we can find the above result starting directly from calculus. If the component of the (net) force in the x direction is given by F(x), then the  acceleration is given by a(x) = \\frac{F(x)}{m}. The velocity is related to the acceleration:a(x) &= \\frac{dv}{dt}\\\\\n\\therefore dv &= a(x)dt\\\\\n\nWe cannot simply integrate the last equation to find that v=\\int a(x)dt because the acceleration is given as a function of position, a(x), and not a function of time, t. Thus, we cannot simply take the integral over t and must instead “change variables” to take the integral over x. x and t are related through velocity:v &= \\frac{dx}{dt}\\\\\n\\therefore dt &= \\frac{1}{v}dx\n\nWe can thus write:dv &= a(x)dt = a(x)\\frac{1}{v}dx \\\\\n\nThe equation above is called a “separable differential equation”, which can also be written:\\frac{dv}{dx}=\\frac{1}{v}a(x)\n\nThis is called a differential equation because it relates the derivative of a function (the derivative of v with respect to x, on the left) to the function itself (v appears on the right as well). The differential equation is “separable”, because we can separate out all of the quantities that depend on v and on x on different sides of the equation:vdv = a(x)dx\n\nThis last equation says that vdv is equal to a(x)dx. Remember that dx is the length of a very small segment in x, and that dv is the change in velocity over that very small segment. Since the terms on the left and right are equal, if we sum (integrate) the quantity vdv over many segments, that sum must be equal to the sum (integral) of the quantity a(x)dx over the same segments. Let us choose those segment such that for the beginning of the first interval the position and speed are x_0 and v_0, respectively, and the position and speed at the end of the last segment are X and V, respectively. We then must have that:\\int_{v_0}^{V}vdv&=\\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\\\\n \\frac{1}{2}V^2 - \\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 &= \\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\\\\n\\therefore V^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\\\\n\nwhich is the same as we found earlier. If the acceleration is constant, we recover our formula from kinematics:V^2 &= v_0^2+ 2\\int_{x_0}^{X}adx\\\\\n&=v_0^2+ 2a(X-x_0)\\\\\n\\therefore V^2- v_0^2 &= 2a(X-x_0)\n\nExample 6.3\n\n\n\nFigure 9:A block is launched along a frictionless surface by compressing a spring by a distance D. The top panel shows the spring when at rest, and the bottom panel shows the spring compressed by a distance D just before releasing the block.\n\nA block of mass m can slide freely along a frictionless surface. A horizontal spring, with spring constant, k, is attached to a wall on one end, while the other end can move freely, as shown in \n\nFigure 9. A coordinate system is defined such that the x axis is horizontal and the free end of the spring is at x=0 when the spring is at rest. The block is pushed against the spring so that the spring is compressed by a distance D. The block is then released. What speed will the block have when it leaves the spring?\n\nSolution\n\nAs you recall, the force exerted by a spring depends on the compression or extension of the spring and is given by Hooke’s Law:\\vec F(x) = -kx\\hat x\n\nwhere x is the position of the free end of the spring and x=0 corresponds to the spring being at rest. In our case, when the edge of the block is located at x_0=-D (the spring is compressed), the force is thus in the positive x direction (since x_0 is a negative number).\n\nThe forces on the block are:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted by the ground.\n\n\\vec F(x), the spring force.\n\nSince the block is not moving vertically, the magnitude of the normal force must equal the weight N=mg, since these are the only forces with components in the vertical direction. The x component of Newton’s Second Law gives us the acceleration of the block (which depends on x):\\sum F_x = -kx &= ma(x)\\\\\n\\therefore a(x)&=-\\frac{k}{m}x\n\nAgain, recall that if x is negative, then the acceleration will be in the positive direction. Since this scenario is exactly the same that we described above in the text, namely a force that varies continuously with position, we can apply the formula that we found earlier for determining the velocity after a varying force has been applied from position x=x_0 to position x=X:V^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\n\nV is the final speed that we would like to find, v_0=0 because the block starts at rest, and x_0=-D is the starting position of the block. X is the position along the x axis where the block leaves the spring.\n\nWe have to think a little about what the value of X should be: when the spring is compressed and the block accelerating, the spring is pushing the block in the positive x direction. Once the block reaches x=0 the spring would want to pull the block backwards, but since it is not attached to the block, it stops exerting a force on the block at that point. The block thus leaves the spring at x=0, so that the final position is X=0. The speed of the block when it leaves the spring is thus:V^2 &= v_0^2 + 2\\int_{x_0}^{X}a(x)dx\\\\\n&= 0 + 2\\int_{-D}^{0}a(x)dx\\\\\n&= 2\\int_{-D}^{0}-\\frac{k}{m}xdx\\\\\n&= 2\\left[ - \\frac{k}{m}\\frac{1}{2}x^2\\right]_{-D}^{0}\\\\\n&= \\frac{k}{m}D^2\\\\\n\\therefore V &= \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}D\n\nDiscussion: This model for the speed of the block when it leaves the spring makes sense because:\n\nThe dimension for the expression for V is correct (you should check this!).\n\nIf the spring is compressed more (bigger value of D), then the speed will be higher.\n\nIf the mass is bigger (more inertia), then the final speed will be lower.\n\nIf the spring is stiffer (bigger value of k), then the final speed will be higher.\n\nIf you have studied physics before, you may have realized that the speed is easily found by conservation of energy:\\frac{1}{2}mV^2=\\frac{1}{2}kD^2\n\nwhich gives the same value for V. As we will see in a later chapter, kinetic and potential energy are defined as they are, precisely because it makes using conservation of energy equivalent to using forces as we just did.\n\nExample 6.4\n\nAn object of mass m is released from rest out of a helicopter. The drag (air-resistance) on the object can be modelled as having a magnitude given by bv, where v is the speed of the object and b is a constant of proportionality. How does the velocity of the object depend on time?\n\nSolution\n\nAs the object falls through the air, the forces exerted on the object are:\n\nF_g, its weight, with magnitude mg, exerted downwards.\n\nF_d, the force of drag, with magnitude bv, exerted upwards.\n\nSince the object will fall in a straight line, this is a one-dimensional problem, and we can choose the x axis to be vertical, with positive x pointing downwards, and the origin located where the object was released. The object will thus have a positive acceleration and move in the positive x direction with this choice of coordinate system. This is illustrated in the free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 10.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Free-body diagram for a block free-falling with drag.\n\nNewton’s Second Law for the object gives:\\sum F_x = F_g - F_d &= ma\\\\\nmg - bv &= ma\\\\\n\\therefore a &= g-\\frac{b}{m}v\n\nIn this case, the acceleration depends explicitly on velocity rather than position, as we had before. However, we can use the same methodology to find how the velocity changes with time. First, we can note that the acceleration is zero if:g-\\frac{b}{m}v &=0\\\\\n\\therefore v = \\frac{mg}{b}\n\nThat is, once the object reaches a speed of v_{term}=mg/b, it will stop accelerating, i.e. it will reach “terminal velocity”. Note that this is the same condition as requiring that the drag force (bv) have the same magnitude as the weight (mg).\n\nWriting the acceleration as a=\\frac{dv}{dt}, we can write:\\frac{dv}{dt} &= \\left(g-\\frac{b}{m}v \\right)\n\nwhich again, is a separable differential equation, in which we can write the terms that depend on v and those that depend on t on separate sides of the equal sign:\\frac{dv}{g-\\frac{b}{m}v}&= dt\\\\\n\\frac{dv}{v-\\frac{mg}{b}}&= -\\frac{b}{m}dt\\\\\n\nwhere we re-arranged the equation in the second line so that it would be easier to integrate in the next step. We can find the velocity, v(t), at some time, t, by stating that v=0 at t=0 and taking the integrals (sum) on both sides. Again, we are modelling the motion as being made up of a large number of very small segments where the quantities on both sides of the equation are the same. Thus, if we sum (integrate) those quantities over all of the same segments, the left and right hand side of the equations will still be equal to each other:\\int_0^{v(t)}\\frac{dv}{v-\\frac{mg}{b}} &= -\\int_0^t\\frac{b}{m} dt\\\\\n\\left[\\ln\\left(v-\\frac{mg}{b} \\right)\\right]_0^{v(t)} &=-\\frac{b}{m}t\\\\\n\\ln\\left(v(t)-\\frac{mg}{b} \\right)-\\ln\\left(-\\frac{mg}{b} \\right)&=-\\frac{b}{m}t\\\\\n\\ln\\left( \\frac{v(t)-\\frac{mg}{b}}{-\\frac{mg}{b}} \\right)&=-\\frac{b}{m}t\\\\\n\nwhere, in the last line, we used the property that \\ln(a)-\\ln(b)=\\ln(a/b). By taking the exponential on either side of the equation (e^{\\ln(x)}=x), we can find an expression for the velocity as a function of time:\\frac{v(t)-\\frac{mg}{b}}{-\\frac{mg}{b}} &= e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}\\\\\nv(t)-\\frac{mg}{b} &= -\\frac{mg}{b}e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}\\\\\n\\therefore v(t) &= \\frac{mg}{b}-\\frac{mg}{b}e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}\\\\\n&=\\frac{mg}{b}\\left(1-e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}\\right)\n\nDiscussion: This equation tells us that the velocity increases as a function of time, but the rate of increase decreases exponentially with time. At time t=0, the velocity is zero, as expected. As t approaches infinity, v approaches, \\frac{mg}{b}, which is the terminal velocity. The time dependence of the velocity is illustrated in \n\nFigure 11.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:Velocity as a function of time for an object of mass m={\\rm 10{kg}} which is free-falling from rest with a drag coefficient b={\\rm{0.5}{Ns/m}}.","type":"content","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#sec-applyingnewtonslaws-modellingwhereforcechanges","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Uniform circular motion"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#uniform-circular-motion","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl2":"Uniform circular motion"},"content":"As we saw in \n\nChapter %s, “uniform circular motion” is defined to be motion along a circle with constant speed. This may be a good time to review \n\nSection 4 for the kinematics of motion along a circle. In particular, for the uniform circular motion of an object around a circle of radius R, you should recall that:\n\nThe velocity vector, \\vec v, is always tangent to the circle.\n\nThe acceleration vector, \\vec a, is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, because the magnitude of the velocity vector does not change.\n\nThe acceleration vector, \\vec a, always points towards the centre of the circle.\n\nThe acceleration vector has magnitude a=v^2/R.\n\nThe angular velocity, ω, is related to the magnitude of the velocity vector by v=\\omega R and is constant.\n\nThe angular acceleration, α, is zero for uniform circular motion, since the angular velocity does not change.\n\nIn particular, you should recall that even if the speed is constant, the acceleration vector is always non-zero in uniform circular motion because the velocity changes direction. According to Newton’s Second Law, this implies that there must be a net force on the object that is directed towards the centre of the circle (parallel to the acceleration):\\sum \\vec F = m\\vec a\n\nwhere the acceleration has a magnitude a=v^2/R. Because the acceleration is directed towards the centre of the circle, we sometimes call it a “radial” acceleration (parallel to the radius), a_R, or a “centripetal” acceleration (directed towards the centre), a_c.\n\nConsider an object in uniform circular motion in a horizontal plane on a frictionless surface, as depicted in \n\nFigure 12.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:An object undergoing uniform circular motion on a frictionless surface, as seen from above.\n\nThe only way for the object to undergo uniform circular motion as depicted is if the net force on the object is directed towards the centre of the circle. One way to have a force that is directed towards the centre of the circle is to attach a string between the center of the circle and the object, as shown in \n\nFigure 12. If the string is under tension, the force of tension will always be towards the centre of the circle. The forces on the object are thus:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal forced exerted by the surface.\n\n\\vec T, a force of tension exerted by the string.\n\nThe forces are depicted in the free-body diagram shown in \n\nFigure 13 (as viewed from the side), where we also drew the acceleration vector. Note that this free-body diagram is only “valid” at a particular instant in time since the acceleration vector continuously changes direction and would not always be lined up with the x axis.\n\n\n\n(a)Free-body diagram (side view) for the object from [](#fig:applyingnewtonslaws:circleH_fbd)\n\nWriting out the $x$ and $y$ components of Newton's Second Law:\n```{math}\n\\sum F_x &= T = ma_R\\\\\n\\sum F_y &= N - F_g =0\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 13:Free-body diagram (side view) for the object from \n\nFigure 13\n\nThe y component just tells us that the normal force must have the same magnitude as the weight because the object is not accelerating in the vertical direction. The x component tells us the relation between the magnitudes of the tension in the string and the radial acceleration. Using the speed of the object, we can also write the relation between the tension and the speed:T &= ma_R=m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n\nThus, we find that the tension in the string increases with the square of the speed, and decreases with the radius of the circle.\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Possible trajectories (in red) that the block will follow if the string breaks.```\nAn object is undergoing uniform circular motion in the horizontal plane, when the string connecting the object to the centre of rotation suddenly breaks.

The coefficient of static friction between the tires of the car and the road is \\mu_s. What is the maximum speed with which the car can go around the curve without skidding?\n\nSolution\n\nIf the car is going at constant speed around a circle, then the sum of the forces on the car must be directed towards the centre of the circle. The only force on the car that could be directed towards the centre of the circle is the force of friction between the tires and the road. If the road were perfectly slick (think driving in icy conditions), it would not be possible to drive around a curve since there could be no force of friction. The forces on the car are:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted upwards by the road.\n\n\\vec f_s, a force of static friction between the tires and the road. This is static friction, because the surface of the tire does not move relative to the surface of the road if the car is not skidding. The force of static friction has a magnitude that is at most f_s\\leq\\mu_sN.\n\nThe forces on the car are shown in the free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 16.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Free-body diagram for the car as seen looking at the car from the back (the centre of the curve is towards the left).\n\nThe y component of Newton’s Second Law tells us that the normal force exerted by the road must equal the weight of the car:\\sum F_y = N-F_g&=0\\\\\n\\therefore N &=mg\n\nThe x component relates the force of friction to the radial acceleration (and thus to the speed):\\sum F_x = f_s =ma_R&=m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n\\therefore f_s &= m\\frac{v^2}{R}\n\nThe force of friction must be less than or equal to f_s\\leq\\mu_sN=\\mu_smg (since N=mg from the y component of Newton’s Second Law), which gives us a condition on the speed:f_s = m\\frac{v^2}{R}&\\leq\\mu_smg\\\\\nv^2 &\\leq \\mu_s g R\\\\\n\\therefore v &\\leq \\sqrt{\\mu_s g R}\n\nThus, if the speed is less than \\sqrt{\\mu_s g R}, the car will not skid and the magnitude of the force of static friction, which results in an acceleration towards the centre of the circle, will be smaller or equal to its maximal possible value.\n\nDiscussion: The model for the maximum speed that the car can travel around the curve makes sense because:\n\nThe dimension of \\sqrt{\\mu_s g R} is speed.\n\nThe speed is larger if the radius of the curve is larger (one can go faster around a wider curve without skidding).\n\nThe speed is larger if the coefficient of friction is large (if the force of friction is larger, a larger radial acceleration can be sustained).\n\nExample 6.6\n\n\n\nFigure 17:A ball attached to a string undergoing circular motion in a vertical plane.\n\nA ball is attached to a mass-less string and executing circular motion along a circle of radius R that is in the vertical plane, as depicted in \n\nFigure 17. Can the speed of the ball be constant? What is the minimum speed of the ball at the top of the circle if it is able to make it around the circle?\n\nSolution\n\nThe forces that are acting on the ball are:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec T, a force of tension exerted by the string.\n\nFigure 18 shows the free-body diagram for the forces on the ball at three different locations along the path of the circle.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:A ball attached to a string undergoing circular motion in a vertical plane.\n\nIn order for the ball to go around in a circle, there must be at least a component of the net force on the ball that is directed towards the centre of the circle at all times. In the bottom half of the circle (positions 1 and 2), only the tension can have a component directed towards the centre of the circle.\n\nConsider in particular the position labelled 2, when the string is horizontal and the tension is equal to \\vec T_2. The free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 18 also shows the vector sum of the weight and tension at position 2 (the red arrow labelled \\sum \\vec F), which points downwards and to the left. It is thus clearly impossible for the acceleration vector to point towards the centre of the circle, and the acceleration will have components that are both tangential (a_T) to the circle and radial (a_R), as shown by the vector \\vec a_2 in \n\nFigure 18.\n\nThe radial component of the acceleration will change the direction of the velocity vector so that the ball remains on the circle, and the tangential component will reduce the magnitude of the velocity vector. According to our model, it is thus impossible for the ball to go around the circle at constant speed, and the speed must decrease as it goes from position 2 to position 3, no matter how one pulls on the string (you can convince yourself of this by drawing the free-body diagram at any point between points 2 and 3).\n\nThe minimum speed for the ball at the top of the circle is given by the condition that the tension in the string is zero just at the top of the trajectory (position 3). The ball can still go around the circle because, at position 3, gravity is towards the centre of the circle and can thus give an acceleration that is radial, even with no tension. The y component of Newton’s Second Law, at position 3 gives:\\sum F_y = -F_g &= ma_y\\\\\n\\therefore a_y &=-g\n\nThe magnitude of the acceleration is the radial acceleration, and is thus related to the speed at the top of the trajectory:a_R&=-a_y=g = \\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n\\therefore v_{min}&=\\sqrt{gR}\n\nwhich is the minimum speed at the top of the trajectory for the ball to be able to continue along the circle. The tension in the string would change as the ball moves around the circle, and will be highest at the bottom of the trajectory, since the tension has to be bigger than gravity so that the net force at the bottom of the trajectory is upwards (towards the centre of the circle).\n\nDiscussion: The model for the minimum speed of the ball at the top of the circle makes sense because:\n\n\\sqrt{gR} has the dimension of speed.\n\nThe minimum velocity is larger if the circle has a larger radius (try this with a mass attached at the end of a string).\n\nThe minimum velocity is larger if the mass is bigger (again, try this at home!).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nConsider a ball attached to a string, being spun in a vertical circle (such as the one depicted in \n\nFigure 17). If you shortened the string, how would the minimum angular velocity (measured at the top of the trajectory) required for the ball to make it around the circle change?\n\nIt would decrease\n\nIt would stay the same\n\nIt would increase\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#uniform-circular-motion","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Banked curves","lvl2":"Uniform circular motion"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#banked-curves","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 6 - Applying Newton's Laws","lvl3":"Banked curves","lvl2":"Uniform circular motion"},"content":"As we saw in \n\nExample 6.5, there is a maximum speed with which a car can go around a curve before it starts to skid. You may have noticed that roads, highways especially, are banked where there are curves. Racetracks for cars that go around an oval (the boring kind of car races) also have banked curves. As we will see, this allows the speed of vehicles to be higher when going around the curve; or rather, it makes the curves safer as the speed at which vehicles would skid is higher. In \n\nExample 6.5, we saw that it was the force of static friction between the tires of the car and the road that provided the only force with a component towards the centre of the circle. The idea of using a banked curve is to change the direction of the normal force between the road and the car tires so that it, too, has a component in the direction towards the centre of the circle.\n\nConsider the car depicted in \n\nFigure 19 which is seen from behind making a left turn around a curve that is banked by an angle θ with respect to the horizontal and can be modelled as an arc from a circle of radius R.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:A car moving into the page and going around a banked curved so that it is turning towards the left (the centre of the circle is to the left).\n\nThe forces exerted on the car are the same as in \n\nExample 6.5, except that they point in different directions. The forces are:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted by the road, perpendicular to the surface of the road.\n\n\\vec f_s, a force of static friction between the tires and the road. This is static friction, because the surface of the tire does not move relative to the surface of the road if the car is not skidding. The force of static friction has a magnitude that is at most f_s\\leq\\mu_sN and is perpendicular to the normal force. The force could be either upwards or downwards, depending on the other forces on the car.\n\nA free-body diagram for the forces on the car is shown in \n\nFigure 20, along with the acceleration (which is in the radial direction, towards the centre of the circle), and our choice of coordinate system (choosing x parallel to the acceleration). The direction of the force of static friction is not known a priori and depends on the speed of the car:\n\nIf the speed of the car is zero, the force of static friction is upwards. With a speed of zero, the radial acceleration is zero, and the sum of the forces must thus be zero. The impeding motion of the car would be to slide down the banked curve (just like a block on an incline).\n\nIf the speed of the car is very large, the force of static friction is downwards, as the impeding motion of the car would be to slide up the bank. The natural motion of the car is to go in a straight line (Newton’s First Law). If the components of the normal force and of the force of static friction directed towards the centre of the circle are too small to allow the car to turn, then the car would slide up the bank (so the impeding motion is up the bank and the force of static friction is downwards).\n\n\n\nFigure 20:Free-body diagram for the forces on the car. The direction of the force of static friction cannot be determined, as it depends on the acceleration of the car, so it is shown twice (with dotted lines).\n\nThere is thus an “ideal speed” at which the force of static friction is precisely zero, and the x component of the normal force is responsible for the radial acceleration. At higher speeds, the force of static friction is downwards and increases in magnitude to keep the car’s acceleration towards the centre of the circle. At some maximal  speed, the force of friction will reach its maximal value, and no longer be able to keep the car’s acceleration pointing towards the centre of the circle. At speeds lower than the ideal speed, the force of friction is directed upwards to prevent the car from sliding down the bank. If the coefficient of static friction is too low, it is possible that at low speeds, the car would start to slide down the bank (so there would be a minimum speed below which the car would start to slide down).\n\nLet us model the situation where the force of static friction is identically zero so that we can determine the ideal speed for the banked curve. The only two forces on the car are thus its weight and the normal force.

This is because of your inertia (Newton’s First Law), and your body would go in a straight line if the car were not exerting a net force on you towards the centre of the circle. You are not so much feeling a force that is pushing you outwards as you are feeling the effects of the car seat pushing you inwards; if you were leaning against the side of the car that is on the outside of the curve, you would feel the side of the car pushing you inwards towards the centre of the curve, even if it “feels” like you are pushing outwards against the side of the car.\n\nIf we model your motion looking at you from the ground, we would include a force of friction between the car seat (or the side of the car, or both) and you that is pointing towards the centre of the circle, so that the sum of the forces exerted on you is towards the centre of the circle. We can also model your motion from the non-inertial frame of the car. As you recall, because this is a non-inertial frame of reference, we need to include an additional inertial force, \\vec F_I, that points opposite of the acceleration of the car, with magnitude F_I=ma_R (if the net acceleration of the car is a_R). Inside the non-inertial frame of reference of the car, your acceleration (relative to the reference frame, i.e. the car) is zero.

The inertial force is not a real force in the sense that it is not exerted by anything. It only comes into play because we are trying to use Newton’s Laws in a non-inertial frame of reference. However, it does provide a good model for describing the sensation that we have of being pushed outwards when the car goes around a curve. Sometimes, people will refer to this force as a “centrifugal” force, which means “a force that points away from the centre”. You should however remember that this is not a real force exerted on the object, but is the result of modelling motion in a non-inertial frame of reference.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nJamie is driving his tricycle around a circular pond.

Once the turntable is going fast enough, the force of friction will no longer be large enough to provide the total acceleration that is required to keep the ant moving with the turntable (with a constant tangential component of the acceleration and an increasing radial component of the acceleration).\n\nThe forces on the ant are:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted by the turntable on the ant.\n\n\\vec f_s, a force of static friction exerted by the turntable on the ant. The force of friction will be such that it has both radial and tangential components.\n\nA free-body diagram for the forces on the ant is shown in \n\nFigure 23, as seen from above and from the side, for some point in time. We have chosen the point in time to be just when the ant is about to slide off of the turntable, when the force of static friction makes an unknown angle θ with the x axis. We have placed the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of the turntable and chosen the x axis such that the ant is located on the positive x axis with its velocity in the positive y direction. We used a three dimensional coordinate system where the weight and normal force are exerted in the z (vertical) direction since the acceleration vector of the ant will have both radial (x) and tangential (y) components.\n\n\n\nFigure 23:(Left:) Forces on the ant as seen from above.

If they go faster, the normal force from their seat (downwards, since they are upside-down), would result in a larger net force towards the centre of the circle.

Since the roller coaster is quoted as having a speed of 15 {\\rm m/s} at the top of the loop, they will just barely make it. However, this is way too close to the minimal speed to not fall out of the roller coaster, so Kenny is correct in being sceptical! The engineers designing the roller coaster should include a much bigger safety margin!\n\nThe sum of the forces is often called the “net force” on an object, and in the specific case of uniform circular motion, that net force is sometimes called the “centripetal force” - however, it is not a force in and of itself and it is always the sum of the forces that points towards the centre of the circle.","type":"content","url":"/applyingnewtonslaws#solutions","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/workenergy","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/workenergy","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/workenergy#chap-workenergy","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"In this chapter, we introduce a new way to build models derived from Newton’s theory of classical physics.

Work is a scalar quantity that is meant to represent how a force exerted on an object over a given distance results in a change in speed of that object. We will first introduce the concept of work done by a force on an object, and then look at how work can change the kinematics of the object. This is analogous to how we first defined the concept of force, and then looked at how force affects motion (by using Newton’s Second Law, which connected the concept of force to the acceleration of the object).\n\nThe work done by a force, \\vec F, on an object over a displacement, \\vec d, is defined to be:\\boxed{W = \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d = Fd\\cos\\theta = F_xd_x+F_yd_y+F_zd_z}\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the vectors when they are placed tail to tail, as in \n\nFigure 1.

We say that the force “does work” if it is exerted while the object moves (has a displacement vector) and in such a way that the scalar product of the force and displacement vectors is non-zero. A force that is perpendicular to the displacement vector of an object does no work (since the scalar product of two perpendicular vectors is zero).  A force exerted in the same direction as the displacement will do positive work (\\cos\\theta positive), and a force in the opposite direction of the displacement will do negative work (\\cos\\theta negative). As we will see, positive work corresponds to increasing the speed of the object, whereas negative work corresponds to decreasing its speed.

Many theorists, over many years, tried all sorts of quantities and ways to rephrase Newton’s Theory that were not helpful. The quantities that make it into textbooks are the ones that turned out to be useful. You should also keep in mind that, just like force, work is a “made-up” mathematical tool that is helpful in describing the world around us.

What is the work done by the block on the spring over the same displacement?\n\n\n\nFigure 5:A block is pressed against a horizontal spring so as to compress the spring by a distance D relative to its rest length.\n\nSolution\n\nThe force exerted by the spring on the block changes continuously with position, according to Hooke’s law:\\vec F(x) = -kx \\hat x\n\nand points in the positive x direction when the end of the spring has a negative x position (with our coordinate choice illustrated in \n\nFigure 5, where the origin is located at the rest length of the spring). To calculate the work done by the force, we sum the work done by the force over many infinitesimally small displacements d\\vec x (using an integral):W &= \\int_{-D}^0 \\vec F(x) \\cdot d\\vec x\\\\\n&=\\int_{-D}^0 (-kx \\hat x) \\cdot (dx \\hat x)\\\\\n&=\\int_{-D}^0 -kxdx (\\hat x \\cdot \\hat x)\\\\\n&=-\\int_{-D}^0 kx dx\\\\\n&=-\\left[\\frac{1}{2}kx^2  \\right]_{-D}^0\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}kD^2\n\nIn order to determine the work that was done by the block on the spring, we need to determine the force, \\vec F'(x), exerted by the block on the spring. By Newton’s Third Law, this is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the spring on the block:\\vec F'(x) = -\\vec F(x) = kx \\hat x\n\nThe work done by the block on the spring over the same displacement is:W' &= \\int_{-D}^0 \\vec F'(x) \\cdot d\\vec x\\\\\n&=\\int_{-D}^0 (kx \\hat x) \\cdot (dx \\hat x)\\\\\n&=\\int_{-D}^0 kx dx=-\\frac{1}{2}kD^2\\\\\n\nwhich is negative. This makes sense because the force exerted by the block on the spring is in the direction opposite to the direction of displacement, so the work should be negative.","type":"content","url":"/workenergy#work-in-one-dimension-varying-force","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl3":"Work in multiple dimensions","lvl2":"Work"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/workenergy#work-in-multiple-dimensions","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl3":"Work in multiple dimensions","lvl2":"Work"},"content":"First, consider the work done by a force \\vec F in pulling a crate over a displacement \\vec d, in the case where the force is directed at an angle θ above the horizontal, as shown in \n\nFigure 6, and the displacement is along the x axis (or rather, we chose the x axis to be parallel to the displacement).\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A force, \\vec F, exerted on an object as it moves from position x=x_0 to position x=x_1.\n\nThe work done by the force is given by:W = \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d &= Fd\\cos\\theta\\\\\n&= F_{\\parallel}d\\\\\n&= Fd_{\\parallel}\\\\\n\nwhere we highlighted the fact that the scalar product “picks out” components of vectors that are parallel to each other.

The magnitude of the crates’ displacement is the same, but Dean’s crate moves horizontally on the ground while Brent’s crate moves up a frictionless ramp that is parallel to the rope used to pull the crate. Who did more work on the crate?\n\nDean because there is friction between his crate and the ground.\n\nBrent.\n\nThey did the same amount of work.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nIn general, if an object is moving along an arbitrary path, we cannot choose the x axis to be parallel to the displacement or to the force. If the path can be sub-divided into straight segments over which the force is constant, as in \n\nFigure 7, we can calculate the work done by the force over each segment and add the work done in each segment together to obtain the total work done by the force. Note that, in general, the work done by a force as an object moves from one position to another depends on the particular path that was taken between the two positions, since different paths will have difference lengths.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:An arbitrary two dimensional path of an object from A to B broken into three straight segments.\n\nExample 7.2\n\nCompare the work done by the force of kinetic friction in sliding a crate along a horizontal surface from position A (coordinates x_A, y_A) to position B (coordinates x_B, y_B) using the two different paths depicted in \n\nFigure 8. Assume that the mass of the crate is m and that the coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the ground is \\mu_k.\n\n\n\nFigure 8:Two possible paths to slide a crate from position A to position B, as seen from above.\n\nSolution\n\nThe force of kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite to that of motion. Thus, regardless of the path taken, the force of friction will do negative work.\n\nLet us first calculate the work done by the force of kinetic friction along the first path (the straight line). The force of kinetic friction will have a magnitude:f_k = \\mu_k N = \\mu_k mg\n\nThe normal force will have the same magnitude as the weight because the crate is not moving (accelerating) in the direction perpendicular to the xy plane.  The displacement vector from A to B can be written as:\\vec d &= (x_B-x_A)\\hat x + (y_B-y_A) \\hat y\\\\\n\\therefore ||\\vec d|| &=d= \\sqrt{(x_B-x_A)^2 + (y_B-y_A)^2}\n\nThe force of kinetic friction will be in the opposite direction of the displacement vector, so the angle between the two vectors is 180{\\rm \\degree} (\\cos\\theta=-1). The work done by the force of kinetic friction is thus:W = \\vec f_k \\cdot\\vec d = f_k d \\cos\\theta = -\\mu_k mg\\sqrt{(x_B-x_A)^2 + (y_B-y_A)^2}\n\nand is negative, as expected.\n\nFor path 2, we break up the motion into two segments, with displacements vectors \\vec d_1 (along y) and \\vec d_2 (along x). We can write the two displacement vectors as:\\vec d_1 &= 0\\hat x + (y_B-y_A) \\hat y\\\\\n\\therefore ||\\vec d_1||&=d_1=(y_B-y_A)\\\\\n\\vec d_2 &= (x_B-x_A)\\hat x + 0 \\hat y\\\\\n\\therefore ||\\vec d_2||&=d_2=(x_B-x_A)\\\\\n\nAlong each segment, the force of kinetic friction is anti-parallel to the displacement (note that the force of friction changes direction over the two segments), but the magnitude is f_k=\\mu_kmg. The work done along the first segment is thus:W_1 = \\vec f_k \\cdot \\vec d_1 = f_k d_1 \\cos\\theta = -\\mu_k mg(y_B-y_A)\n\nThe work done along the second segment is:W_2 = \\vec f_k \\cdot \\vec d_2 = f_k d_2 \\cos\\theta = -\\mu_k mg(x_B-x_A)\n\nAnd the total work done by the force of kinetic friction over the second path is:W^{tot} = W_1 + W_2 = -\\mu_k mg \\left((x_B-x_A) + (y_B-y_A)\\right)\n\nwhich is more work than was done along path 1. This makes sense because for both paths, the force of friction has the same magnitude and is always in the opposite direction of motion; thus, the longer the path, the more work will be done by the force.\n\nExample 7.3\n\nA box of mass m is moved from the floor onto a table using two different paths, as shown in \n\nFigure 9. The table is a horizontal distance L away from where the box starts and a height H above the floor. Compare the work done by the weight of the box along the two possible paths.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:Two possible paths to move a box from the floor onto a table.\n\nSolution\n\nWe can use a coordinate system such that the origin coincides with the initial position of the box. x is horizontal and y is vertical, as shown in \n\nFigure 9. The weight of the box can be written as:\\vec F_g = -mg \\hat y\n\nand points in the negative y direction with a magnitude of mg. To calculate the work done by the weight along the first path, we first determine the corresponding displacement vector, \\vec d:\\vec d = L\\hat x + H\\hat y\n\nand we can then determine the work:W &= \\vec F_g \\cdot \\vec d = (-mg \\hat y) \\cdot (L\\hat x + H\\hat y)\\\\\n&=F_xd_x+F_yd_y= (0)(L) + (-mg)(H)\\\\\n&= -mgH\n\nAlong path 1, the work done by the weight is negative, and does not depend on the horizontal distance L. Let us now calculate the work done along the second path, which we break up into two segments with displacement vectors \\vec d_1 (vertical) and \\vec d_2 (horizontal). The displacement vectors are:\\vec d_1 &= H\\hat y\\\\\n\\vec d_2 &= L\\hat x\n\nThe work done along the vertical segment is:W_1 &= \\vec F_g \\cdot \\vec d_1 = (-mg \\hat y) \\cdot (H\\hat y)\\\\\n&=-mgH\n\nThe work done along the horizontal segment is:W_2 &= \\vec F_g \\cdot \\vec d_2 = (-mg \\hat y) \\cdot (L\\hat x)\\\\\n&=0\n\nwhich is zero, because the force of gravity is always vertical and thus perpendicular to the displacement vector of the horizontal segment. The total work done by the weight along the second path is:W^{tot} = W_1 + W_2 = -mgH\n\nwhich is the same as the work done along path 1. As we will see, when a force is constant in magnitude and direction, the work that it does on an object in going from one position to another is independent of the path taken. This was not the case in \n\nExample 7.2, because the direction of the force of kinetic friction depends on the direction of the displacement.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nClare and Amelia go down two different slides, as shown in \n\nFigure 10. Clare and Amelia have the same mass and the slides have the same non-zero coefficients of friction.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Clare (C) and Amelia (A) go down two different slides of the same height.\n\nFor each of the following forces, decide whether the force: does more work on Clare, does more work on Amelia, or does the same amount of work on both.\n\nThe force of gravity...\n\nThe force of friction...\n\nThe normal force from the slide...\n\nAnswer\n\nGravity does the same amount of work on both, friction does more work on Amelia, and the normal force does the same amount of work on both (the normal force does zero work, since it is always perpendicular to the displacement).\n\nThe most general case for which we can calculate the work done by a force is the case when the force changes continuously along a path where the displacement also changes direction continuously. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 11 which shows an arbitrary path between two points A and B, and a force, \\vec F(\\vec r), that depends on position (\\vec r). In general, the work done by the force on an object that goes from A to B will depend on the actual path that was taken.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:An arbitrary path between two points A and B with a force that depends on position, \\vec F(\\vec r).\n\nThe strategy for calculating the work in the general case is the same: we break up the path into small straight segments with displacement vectors d\\vec l (\n\nFigure 12) where we assume that the force is constant over the segment. The total work is the sum of the work over each segment:\\boxed{W = \\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l}\n\nAs usual, we use the integral symbol to indicate that you need to take an infinite number of infinitely small segments d\\vec l in order to calculate the sum.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:We divide the path into infinitesimally small segments with displacement vectors d\\vec l.\n\nYou should note that this is not an integral like any other that we have seen so far: the integral is not over a single integration variable (usually we use x), but it is the integral (the sum!) over the specific path that we have chosen in going from A to B. This is called a “path integral”, and is generally difficult to evaluate.\n\nExample 7.4\n\n\n\nFigure 13:A parabolic path between A and B.\n\nA force, \\vec F(\\vec r) = \\vec F(x,y) = F_x\\hat x + F_y \\hat y,  is exerted on an object. The object starts at position A and ends at position B, along a parabolic path, y(x) = a+bx^2, as depicted in \n\nFigure 13. What is the work done by the force, \\vec F, along this trajectory?\n\nSolution\n\nIn this case, the force can change with position (if F_x and F_y are not constant), and the direction of the path changes continuously. When we break up the path into small segments d\\vec l, we need to incorporate the equation of the parabola to include the fact that d\\vec l must always be tangent to the parabola. Consider one small segment along the trajectory and the infinitesimal displacement vector d\\vec l at that point, as in \n\nFigure 14.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:The infinitesimal displacement vector, d\\vec l.\n\nWe can write the x and y components of the vector as infinitesimal distances, dx and dy, along the x and y axes, respectively. The vector d\\vec l can thus be written:d\\vec l = dx \\hat x + dy \\hat y\n\nThe total work done by the force is then:W &= \\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\\\\\n&=\\int_A^B (F_x\\hat x + F_y \\hat y) \\cdot (dx \\hat x + dy \\hat y)\\\\\n&=\\int_A^B (F_x dx + F_ydy)\\\\\n\\therefore W&= \\int_A^B F_x dx + \\int_A^B F_ydy\n\nwhere in the last line, we simply used the property that the integral of a sum is the sum of the corresponding integrals. At this point, we have two integrals over integration variables (x and y) that are meaningful. However, we have not yet used the fact that our path is a parabola, and in general, we expect that the shape of the path is important. By saying that we are integrating (or calculating the work) over a specific path, we are really saying that x and y are not independent; that is, if we know the value of x at some point on the path, we know the corresponding value of y (y = a+bx^2).\n\nSince x and y are not independent, we can use a “substitution of variables” in order to express y in terms of x, and dy in terms of dx:y(x) &= a + bx^2\\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx} &= 2bx\\\\\n\\therefore dy &= 2bxdx\n\nThis allows us to convert the integral over y to an integral over x, which also allows us to be explicit for the limits of the integral (in our example, the integral goes from x=0 to x=x_1):W&= \\int_A^B F_x dx + \\int_A^B F_ydy\\\\\n&=\\int_0^{x_1} F_x dx + \\int_0^{x_1} F_y(2bxdx)\\\\\n&=\\int_0^{x_1} (F_x + 2bxF_y)dx\n\nwhere we would need to know how F_x and F_y depends on x and y in order to actually evaluate the integral.\n\nFor example, if the force were constant (F_x and F_y constant), then the work done along the parabolic path would be:W &= \\int_0^{x_1} (F_x + 2bxF_y)dx\\\\\n&=\\left[F_x x + bF_yx^2  \\right]_0^{x_1}\\\\\n&=F_x x_1 + bF_yx_1^2\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, if the force is constant in magnitude and direction, then the work done is independent of path. We can easily check this, using the displacement vector \\vec d = x_1\\hat x + bx_1^2 \\hat y:W &= \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d = (F_x\\hat x+ F_y\\hat y) \\cdot (x_1\\hat x + bx_1^2 \\hat y)\\\\\n&=F_x x_1 + bF_yx_1^2\n\nas we found above.","type":"content","url":"/workenergy#work-in-multiple-dimensions","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl3":"Net work done","lvl2":"Work"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/workenergy#net-work-done","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl3":"Net work done","lvl2":"Work"},"content":"So far, we have considered the work done on an object by a single force. If more than one force is exerted on an object, then each force can do work on the object, and we can calculate the “net work” done on the object by adding together the work done by each force. We will show that this is equivalent to first calculating the net force on the object, F^{net} (i.e. the vector sum of the forces on the object), and then calculating the work done by the net force.\n\nSuppose that three forces, \\vec F_1, \\vec F_2, and \\vec F_3 are exerted on an object as it moves such that its displacement vector is \\vec d.

The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the incline is \\mu_k. You push in such a way that that crates moves at a constant speed up the incline. What is the net work done on the crate if it moves up the incline by a distance d?\n\n\n\nFigure 15:A crate being pushed up an incline.\n\nSolution\n\nAlthough the answer may be obvious, let’s go the long way about it and calculate the work done by each force, and then sum them together to get the total work done. We start by identifying the forces exerted on the crate:\n\n\\vec F, the applied force, of unknown magnitude, \\vec F.\n\n\\vec F_g, the weight of the crate, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted by the incline.\n\n\\vec f_k, a force of kinetic friction, with magnitude \\mu_k N, that points in the direction opposite of \\vec d.\n\nThese are shown in the free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 16, along with our choice of coordinate system, and the displacement vector.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Free-body diagram for the crate on the incline.\n\nWith our choice of coordinate system, the displacement vector is given by:\\vec d = d (\\cos\\theta \\hat x + \\sin\\theta \\hat y)\n\nBefore calculating the work done by each force, we need to determine the magnitude of the normal force (and thus of the force of kinetic friction). Since the crate is moving at a constant velocity, its acceleration is zero, so the sum of the forces must be zero. Writing out the y component of Newton’s Second Law allows us to find the magnitude of the normal force:\\sum F_y &= N\\cos\\theta -F_g - f_k\\sin\\theta = 0\\\\\n\\therefore mg &= N\\cos\\theta-\\mu_kN\\sin\\theta = N(\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta)\\\\\n\\therefore N &= \\frac{mg}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta}\n\nWriting out the x component of Newton’s Second Law allows us to find the magnitude of the unknown force F:\\sum F_x &= F - N\\sin\\theta - f_k\\cos\\theta = 0\\\\\n\\therefore F &= N\\sin\\theta+\\mu_kN\\cos\\theta = N(\\sin\\theta+\\mu_k\\cos\\theta)\\\\\n&=mg\\frac{\\sin\\theta+\\mu_k\\cos\\theta}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta}\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the work done by each force. The work done by the normal force is identically zero, since it is perpendicular to the displacement vector. The work done by the applied force, \\vec F = F\\hat x, is:W_F &= \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d = (F\\hat x)\\cdot(d (\\cos\\theta \\hat x + \\sin\\theta \\hat y))\\\\\n&=Fd\\cos\\theta=mg\\frac{\\sin\\theta+\\mu_k\\cos\\theta}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta}d\\cos\\theta\n\nThe work done by the force of gravity, \\vec F_g = -mg \\hat y, is:W_g &= \\vec F_g \\cdot \\vec d = (-mg \\hat y)\\cdot(d (\\cos\\theta \\hat x + \\sin\\theta \\hat y))\\\\\n&=-mgd\\sin\\theta\n\nThe work done by the force of friction, \\vec f_k, noting that \\vec f_k and \\vec d are antiparallel:W_f &= \\vec f_k \\cdot \\vec d = -f_kd = -\\mu_kNd\\\\\n&=-\\mu_k\\frac{mg}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta}d\n\nThe net work done on the crate is thus:W^{net}&=W_F + W_g + W_f\\\\\n&=mg\\frac{\\sin\\theta+\\mu_k\\cos\\theta}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta}d\\cos\\theta-mgd\\sin\\theta -\\mu_k\\frac{mg}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta}d\\\\\n&=mgd \\left(  \\frac{\\sin\\theta+\\mu_k\\cos\\theta}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta}\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta - \\mu_k\\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta} \\right)\\\\\n&=mgd \\left(  \\frac{(\\sin\\theta+\\mu_k\\cos\\theta)\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta(\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta) - \\mu_k}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta} \\right)\\\\\n&=mgd \\left(  \\frac{\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+\\mu_k\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+\\mu_k\\sin^2\\theta - \\mu_k}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta} \\right)\\\\\n&=mgd \\left(  \\frac{\\mu_k(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta) - \\mu_k}{\\cos\\theta-\\mu_k\\sin\\theta} \\right)\\\\\n&=0\n\nwhere we used the fact that \\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta=1. Thus we find that the net work done on the crate is zero!\n\nDiscussion: Of course, this makes sense, because the net force on the crate is zero, since it is not accelerating, so the net work done is also zero. As a consequence, or rather, by construction, we have the condition that if the net work done on an object is zero, then that object does not accelerate. We thus have a scalar quantity (work) that can tell us something about whether an object is changing speed. In the next section, we introduce a new quantity, “kinetic energy”, to describe how an object’s speed changes when the net work done is not zero.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nPay close attention to the words “on” and “by.” There are a few things about this that can be tricky:\n\nIn \n\nExample 7.5, we were asked to find the net work done on the crate. Sometimes, the question won’t specify that it wants you to find the net work, and will just say “What is the work done on the crate?” When you are just asked for the work done “on” an object, the question is implicitly asking for the net work done on the object.\n\nJust because the net work done on an object is zero doesn’t mean that the work done by each of the forces is zero. This may seem obvious, but it’s easy to get tripped up on a test or exam. If you are reading a question about work and it says that the object is moving at a constant speed, it’s tempting to just jump ahead and say that the work must be equal to zero. However, you can only say this if it’s asking you for the net work done on the object. For instance, in \n\nExample 7.5, we concluded that since the crate was moving at a constant speed, the net work was equal to zero. But if the question asked you to find the work done on the crate by gravity, that would mean something different. The work done by gravity in this case is not equal to zero (it’s actually negative).\n\nThe work done “on” an object is not the same as the net work done “by” that object. For example, say you are in a tug-of-war and you pull the other team towards you, but you yourself do not move. The net work done on you is zero, but the work done by you is not zero. So, when you are talking about work, you should always state explicitly whether the work is being done “on” the object or “by” the object.\n\nNote: The wording won’t always be like this - sometimes it will say “How much work do you do on the box?” instead of “How much work is done by you on the box,” so always be careful. Still, looking for key words like “by” and “on” is a good place to start.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA 2 {\\rm kg} box sits on a horizontal surface. A constant horizontal force of 6 {\\rm N} is applied to the box. The box moves with a constant acceleration of 2 {\\rm m/s^2}. Which of the following has the greatest magnitude?\n\nThe work done by the applied force.\n\nThe work done by friction.\n\nThe net work done on the box.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/workenergy#net-work-done","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Kinetic energy and the work energy theorem"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/workenergy#sec-workenergy-kinetic","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Kinetic energy and the work energy theorem"},"content":"At this point, you should be comfortable calculating the net work done on an object upon which several forces are exerted. As we saw in the previous section, the net work done on an object is connected to the object’s acceleration; if the net force on the object is zero, then the net work done and acceleration are also zero. In this section, we derive a new quantity, kinetic energy, which allows us to connect the work done on an object with its change in speed. This will allow us to describe motion using only scalar quantities. Like the definition of work, the following derivation appears to “come out of thin air”. Remember, though, that theorists have tried all sorts of mathematical tricks to reformulate Newton’s Theory, and this is the one that worked.\n\nConsider the most general case of an object of mass m acted upon by a net force, \\vec F^{net}(\\vec r), which can vary in magnitude and direction. We wish to calculate the  net work done on the object as it moves along an arbitrary path between two points, A and B, in space, as shown in \n\nFigure 17. The instantaneous acceleration of the object, \\vec a, is shown along with an “element of the path”, d\\vec l.\n\n\n\nFigure 17:An object moving along an arbitrary path between points A and B that is acted upon by a net force \\vec F^{net}.\n\nThe net work done on the object can be written:W^{net} = \\int_A^B F^{net}(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nand is in general a difficult integral to evaluate for an arbitrary path. Our goal is to find a way to evaluate this integral by finding a function, K, with the property that:\\int_A^B F^{net}(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l =K_B - K_A\n\nThat is, we will only have to evaluate K at the end points of the path in order to determine the value of the integral. In this way, the function K is akin to an anti-derivative.\n\nIn order to determine the form for the function K, we start by noting that, by using Newton’s Second Law, we can write the integral for work in terms of the acceleration of the object:\\sum \\vec F &= \\vec F^{net} = m\\vec a\\\\\n\\therefore \\int_A^B F^{net}(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l &= \\int_A^B m\\vec a\\cdot d\\vec l =m\\int_A^B \\vec a\\cdot d\\vec l\n\nwhere we assumed that the mass of the object does not change along the path and can thus be factored out of the integral. Consider the scalar product of the acceleration, \\vec a, and the path element, d\\vec l=dx\\hat x  +dy\\hat y + dz\\hat z, written in terms of the velocity vector:\\vec a & = \\frac{d\\vec v}{dt}\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec a\\cdot d\\vec l &= \\frac{d\\vec v}{dt}\\cdot d\\vec l\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{dv_x}{dt}\\hat x+ \\frac{dv_y}{dt}\\hat y + \\frac{dv_z}{dt}\\hat z\\right) \\cdot (dx\\hat x  +dy\\hat y + dz\\hat z)\\\\\n&=\\frac{dv_x}{dt}dx+\\frac{dv_y}{dt}dy+\\frac{dv_z}{dt}dz\n\nAny of the terms in the sum can be re-arranged so that the time derivative acts on the element of path (dx, dy, or dz) instead of the velocity, for example:\\frac{dv_x}{dt}dx = \\frac{dx}{dt}dv_x\n\nwhere we recognize that \\frac{dx}{dt} = v_x. We can thus write the scalar product between the acceleration vector and the path element as:\\vec a\\cdot d\\vec l&= \\frac{dv_x}{dt}dx+\\frac{dv_y}{dt}dy+\\frac{dv_z}{dt}dz\\\\\n&=\\frac{dx}{dt}dv_x + \\frac{dy}{dt}dv_y+\\frac{dz}{dt}dv_z\\\\\n&=v_xdv_x + v_ydv_y + v_zdv_z\n\nThe integral for the net work done can be written as:W^{net} &= \\int_A^B F^{net}(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l =m \\int_A^B (v_xdv_x + v_ydv_y + v_zdv_z)\\\\\n&=m\\int_A^B v_xdv_x +m\\int_A^B  v_ydv_y + m\\int_A^B v_zdv_z\n\nwhich corresponds to the sum of three integrals over the three independent components of the velocity vector. The components of the velocity vector are functions that change over the path and have fixed values at either end of the path. Let the velocity vector of the object at point A be \\vec v_A=(v_{Ax}, v_{Ay}, v_{Az}) and the velocity vector at point B be \\vec v_B=(v_{Bx}, v_{By}, v_{Bz}). The integral over, say, the x component of velocity is then:m\\int_A^B v_xdv_x &= m\\int_{v_{Ax}}^{v_{Bx}} v_xdv_x= m\\left[\\frac{1}{2}v_x^2  \\right]_{v_{Ax}}^{v_{Bx}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}m(v_{Bx}^2-v_{Ax}^2)\n\nWe can thus write the net work integral as:W^{net} &=m\\int_A^B v_xdv_x +m\\int_A^B  v_ydv_y + m\\int_A^B v_zdv_z\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}m(v_{Bx}^2-v_{Ax}^2) + \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{By}^2-v_{Ay}^2) +\\frac{1}{2}m(v_{Bz}^2-v_{Az}^2)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}m(v_{Bx}^2+v_{By}^2+v_{Bz}^2)-\\frac{1}{2}m(v_{Ax}^2+v_{Ay}^2+v_{Az}^2)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_A^2\n\nwhere we recognized that the magnitude (squared) of the velocity is given by v_A^2 = v_{Ax}^2+v_{Ay}^2+v_{Az}^2. We have thus arrived at our desired result; namely, we have found a function of speed, K(v), that when evaluated at the endpoints of the path allows us to calculate the net work done on the object over that path:\\boxed{K(v) = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2}\n\nThat is, if you know the speed at the start of the path, v_A, and the speed at the end of the path, v_B, then the net work done on the object along the path between A and B is given by:\\boxed{W^{net} = \\Delta K = K(v_B) - K(v_a)}\n\nWe call K(v) the “kinetic energy” of the object. We can say that the net work done on an object in going from A to B is equal to its change in kinetic energy (final kinetic energy minus initial kinetic energy). It is important to note that we defined kinetic energy in a way that it is equal to the net work done. You may have already seen kinetic energy from past introductions to physics as a quantity that is just given; here, we instead derived a function that has the desired property of being equal to the net work done and called it “kinetic energy”.\n\nThe relation between the net work done and the change in kinetic energy is called the “Work-Energy Theorem” (or Work-Energy Principle). It is the connection that we were looking for between the dynamics (the forces from which we calculate work) and the kinematics (the change in kinetic energy). Unlike Newton’s Second Law, which relates two vector quantities (the vector sum of the forces and the acceleration vector), the Work-Energy Theorem relates two scalar quantities to each other (work and kinetic energy). Although we introduced the kinetic energy as a way to calculate the integral for the net work, if you know the value of the net work done on an object, then the Work-Energy Theorem can be used to calculate the change in speed of the object.\n\nMost importantly, the Work-Energy theorem introduces the concept of “energy”. As we will see in later chapters, there are other forms of energy in addition to work and kinetic energy. The Work-Energy Theorem is the starting point for the idea that you can convert one form of energy into another. The Work-Energy Theorem tells us how a force, by doing work, can provide kinetic energy to an object or remove kinetic energy from an object.\n\nExample 7.6\n\nA net work of W was done on an object of mass m that started at rest. What is the speed of the object after the work has been done on the object?\n\nSolution\n\nUsing the Work-Energy Theorem:W = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2\n\nwhere v_i is the initial speed of the object and v_f is its final speed. Since the initial speed is zero, we can easily find the final speed:v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{m}}\n\nExample 7.7\n\nA block is pressed against the free end of a horizontal spring with spring constant, k, so as to compress the spring by a distance D relative to its rest length, as shown in \n\nFigure 18. The other end of the spring is fixed to a wall.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:A block is pressed against a horizontal spring so as to compress the spring by a distance D relative to its rest length.\n\nIf the block is released from rest and there is no friction between the block and the horizontal surface, what is the speed of the block when it leaves the spring?\n\nSolution\n\nThis is the same problem that we presented in \n\nSection 6.3.1 in \n\nExample 6.3, where we solved a differential equation to find the speed.\n\nOur first step is to calculate the net work done on the object in going from x=-D to x=0 (which corresponds to when the object leaves the spring, as discussed in \n\nExample 6.3). The forces on the object are:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, the normal force exerted by the ground.\n\n\\vec F(x), the force from the spring, with magnitude kx.\n\nBoth the normal force and weight are perpendicular to the displacement, so they will do no work. The net work done is thus the work done by the spring, which we calculated in \n\nExample 7.1 to be:W^{net} = W_F = \\frac{1}{2}kD^2\n\nBy the Work-Energy Theorem, this is equal to the change in kinetic energy. Noting that the object started at rest (v_i=0), the final speed v_f is found to be:W^{net} &=  \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 =  \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}kD^2 &=\\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2\\\\\n\\therefore v_f &=\\sqrt{\\frac{kD^2}{m}}\n\nExample 7.8\n\nA block is pressed against the free end of a horizontal spring with spring constant, k, so as to compress the spring by a distance D relative to its rest length, as shown in \n\nFigure 19. The other end of the spring is fixed to a wall.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:A block is pressed against a horizontal spring so as to compress the spring by a distance D relative to its rest length.\n\nIf the block is released from rest and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the horizontal surface is \\mu_k, what is the speed of the block when it leaves the spring?\n\nSolution\n\nThis is the same example as the previous one, but with kinetic friction. The forces on the block are:\n\n\\vec F_g, its weight, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, the normal force exerted by the ground on the block.\n\n\\vec F(x), the force from the spring, with magnitude kx.\n\n\\vec f_k, the force of kinetic friction, with magnitude \\mu_kN.\n\nBoth the normal force and weight are perpendicular to the displacement, so they will do no work. Furthermore, since the acceleration in the vertical direction is zero, the normal force will have the same magnitude as the weight (N=mg). The magnitude of the force of kinetic friction is thus f_k = \\mu_k mg. The net work done will be the sum of the work done by the spring, W_F, and the work done by friction, W_f:W^{net} = W_F + W_f\n\nWe have already determined the work done by the spring:W_F = \\frac{1}{2}kD^2\n\nThe work done by the force of kinetic friction will be negative (since it is in the direction opposite of the motion) and is given by:W_f = \\vec f_k \\cdot \\vec d = -f_kD = -\\mu_kmgD\n\nApplying the work energy theorem, and noting that the block started at rest (v_i=0), the final speed v_f is found to be:W^{net} =W_F + W_f&= \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}kD^2-\\mu_kmgD  &=\\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2\\\\\n\\therefore v_f &=\\sqrt{\\frac{kD^2}{m}-2\\mu_kgD}\n\nDiscussion: We can think of this in terms of the concept of energy. The spring does positive work on the block, and so it increases its kinetic energy. Friction does negative work on the block, decreasing its kinetic energy. Only the spring is “introducing” energy into the block, as friction is removing that energy by doing negative work. Another way to think about it is that the spring is inputting energy; some of that energy goes into increasing the kinetic energy of the block, and some of it is lost by friction.\n\nThe energy that is lost to friction can be thought of as “thermal energy” (heat) that goes up into heating the block and the surface. Indeed, if you rub your hand against the table, you will notice that it gets warmer; you are losing some of the energy introduced to your hand by the work done by your arm into heating up the table and your hand! This shows that we can think about modelling friction using thermal energy rather than a force.","type":"content","url":"/workenergy#sec-workenergy-kinetic","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Power"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/workenergy#power","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Power"},"content":"We finish the chapter by introducing the concept of “power”, which is the rate at which work is done on an object, or more generally, the rate at which energy is being converted from one form to another. If an amount of work, \\Delta W, was done in a period of time \\Delta t, then the work was done at a rate of:\\boxed{P = \\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta t}}\n\nwhere P is called the power. The SI unit for power is the “Watt”, abbreviated \\text{W}, which corresponds to {\\rm J/s}={\\rm kg m^2/s^3} in base SI units. If the rate at which work is being done changes with time, then the instantaneous power is defined as:\\boxed{P = \\frac{dW}{dt}}\n\nYou have probably already encountered power in your everyday life. For example, your 1000 {\\rm W} hair dryer consumes “electrical energy” at a rate of 1000 {\\rm J} per second and converts it into the kinetic energy of the fan as well as the thermal energy to heat up the air. Horsepower (\\text{hp}) is an imperial unit of power that is often used for vehicles, the conversion being 1 {\\rm hp} = 746 {\\rm W}.

You find that you need to exert a force of \\vec F on the crate in order to overcome the friction between the crate and the ground. How much power are you expending by pushing on the crate?\n\nSolution\n\nWe need to calculate the rate at which the force, \\vec F, that you exert on the crate does work. If the crate is moving at constant speed, v, then in a time \\Delta t, it will cover a distance, d=v\\Delta t. Since you exert a force in the same direction as the motion of the crate, the work done over that distance d is:\\Delta W = \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d = Fd\\cos(0) = Fv\\Delta t\n\nThe power corresponding to the work done in that period of time is thus:P = \\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta t} = Fv\n\nThis is quite a general result for the rate at which a force does work when it is exerted on an object moving at constant speed.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nExample 7.10 ties into what I brought up earlier. If you think to yourself: “The velocity is constant, so the work must be zero”, the formula,P = \\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta t} = Fv\n\nwouldn’t make any sense. Since v is a constant velocity, the power would always be equal to zero, which of course isn’t right. Again, remember that when the velocity is constant, it is only the net work that is equal to zero. In \n\nExample 7.10, it’s asking for the power that you are expending by pushing on the crate (which is the same as asking for the rate of the work done by you on the crate). So, the formula does indeed make sense.","type":"content","url":"/workenergy#power","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/workenergy#summary","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 7 - Work and energy","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"The work, W, done on an object by a force, \\vec F, while the object has moved through a displacement, \\vec d, is defined as the scalar product:W = \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d &= Fd\\cos\\theta\\\\\n&= F_xd_x+F_yd_y+F_zd_z\n\nIf the force changes with position and/or the object moves along an arbitrary path in space, the work done by that force over the path is given by:W =\\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot  d\\vec lWork allows us to quantify how a force acting on an object changes the speed of that object.\n\nIf multiple forces are exerted on an object, then one can calculate the net force on the object (the vector sum of the forces), and the net work done on the object will be equal to the work done by the net force:W^{net} = \\int_A^B \\vec F^{net}(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nIf the net work done on an object is zero, that object does not accelerate.\n\nWe can define the kinetic energy, K(v) of an object of mass m that has speed v as:K(v) = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2\n\nThe Work-Energy Theorem states that the net work done on an object in going from position A to position B is equal to the object’s change in kinetic energy:W^{net} = \\Delta K = \\frac{1}{2} mv_B^2 - \\frac{1}{2} mv_A^2\n\nwhere v_A and v_B are the speed of the object at positions A and B, respectively.\n\nThe rate at which work is being done is called power and is defined as:P = \\frac{dW}{dt}\n\nIf a constant force \\vec F is exerted on an object that has a constant velocity \\vec v, then the power that corresponds to the work being done by that force is:P &= \\frac{d}{dt} W = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\vec F \\cdot \\vec d)\\\\\n&= \\vec F \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec d = \\vec F \\cdot \\vec v\n\nImportant Equations\n\nWork:W &= \\vec F \\cdot \\vec d = Fd\\cos\\theta\\\\\nW &= F_xd_x+F_yd_y+F_zd_z\\\\\nW &=\\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot  d\\vec l\\\\\nW^{net} &= \\int_A^B \\vec F^{net}(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nKinetic Energy:K(v) = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2\n\nWork-Energy Theorem:W^{net} = \\Delta K = \\frac{1}{2} mv_B^2 - \\frac{1}{2} mv_A^2\n\nPower:P &= \\frac{dW}{dt}\\\\\nP &= \\vec F \\cdot \\vec v\n\nImportant Definitions\n\nKinetic energy: A form of energy that an object with a mass has by virtue of having a non-zero speed.

We start by defining a coordinate system. We choose the x axis to be horizontal and positive in the direction of motion, and we choose the y axis to be vertical and the positive direction upwards.\n\nWe will determine the speed at the top of the ramp, v_t, using the Work-Energy Theorem:W^{net}=\\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\\frac{1}{2}mv_t^2\n\nwhere W^{net} is the net work done on the skier as they “fly” through the air. While the skier is in the air, the only force acting on them is gravity, \\vec F=-mg\\hat y. The path of the skier is a parabola, so that the displacement vector changes direction continuously. The work done by gravity is given by:W = \\int \\vec F_g \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nwhere d\\vec l is an infinitesimal displacement along the trajectory, as shown in \n\nFigure 22.\n\n\n\nFigure 22:Infinitesimal displacement along the trajectory of the jump.\n\nThe displacement vector will have x and y components:d\\vec l = dx \\hat x + dy \\hat y\n\nThe scalar product with the force of gravity is thus:\\vec F_g \\cdot d\\vec l &= (-mg\\hat y) \\cdot (dx \\hat x + dy \\hat y)= -mgdy\n\nThe work done by gravity can thus be converted into an integral over y (for which we know the start and end values), and is given by:W = \\int \\vec F_g \\cdot d\\vec l = \\int_h^0 -mgdy = [-mgy]_h^0 = mgh\n\nThe work done by gravity is positive, which makes sense, since the force of gravity is generally in the same direction as the net displacement (downwards). We did not need to take into account the specific shape of the trajectory, because the force was constant in magnitude and direction (see \n\nExample 7.4).\n\nWe can now find the speed of the skier when they leave the jump using the Work-Energy theorem:W^{net}&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\\frac{1}{2}mv_t^2\\\\\nmgh &= \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\\frac{1}{2}mv_t^2\\\\\n\\therefore v_t&=\\sqrt{v_f^2-2gh}=\\sqrt{(12 {\\rm m/s})^2 - 2(9.8 {\\rm m/s^2})(5 {\\rm m})}=6.8 {\\rm m/s}\n\nb. We can again use the Work-Energy Theorem to determine the work done by friction as the skier slides up the ramp. We know that the speed of the skier at the bottom of the ramp is v_i, and we just found that the speed of the skier at the top of the ramp is v_t=\\sqrt{v_f^2-2gh}. The net work done on the skier going up the ramp is equal to:W^{net}&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_t^2-\\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}m(v_t^2-v_i^2) = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2-2gh -v_i^2)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2-v_i^2)-mgh\n\nThe net work done is also the sum of the work done by each of the forces acting on the skier as they slide up the ramp. The forces on the skier are the force of gravity, the force of friction, and the normal force. The normal force does no work, since it is always perpendicular to the displacement. The net work is thus the sum of the work done by the force gravity, W_g, and the work done by the force of friction, W_f, over the displacement corresponding to the length of the ramp:W^{net}=W_g+W_f\n\nThe work done by gravity is:W_g = \\vec F_g \\cdot \\vec d = (-mg\\hat y) \\cdot  (d_x\\hat x + h \\hat y) = -mgh\n\nwhere \\vec d is the displacement vector up the ramp (unknown horizontal distance, d_x, and vertical distance, h). We can now determine the work done by the force of friction:W^{net}&=W_g+W_f\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2-v_i^2)-mgh &=  -mgh + W_f\\\\\n\\therefore W_f &= \\frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2-v_i^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(80 {\\rm kg})((12 {\\rm m/s})^2-(15 {\\rm m/s})^2)=-3240 {\\rm J}\n\nAnd we find that the force of friction did negative work (it reduced the kinetic energy of the skier).\n\nDiscussion: Over the course of the jump, the skier started at the bottom of the ramp with a given kinetic energy, then lost some of that energy going up the ramp (in the form of loss to friction and negative work done by gravity). During the airborne phase, gravity did positive work and the skier gained back some of the kinetic energy that they had lost going up the ramp. Thus the net work done by the force of friction is the difference in kinetic energies between the final landing point and the beginning of the ramp, because friction is the only force that did a net amount of (negative) work over the whole trajectory (gravity did no net work over the whole trajectory). This example shows how we can start to think about energy as something that is “conserved”, which we will explore in more detail in the next chapter.\n\nSolution\n\na. We want to find the work done by the applied force \\vec F. We first need to find an expression for the magnitude of \\vec F, based on the fact that the child is not accelerating. The forces on the child are:\n\n\\vec F_g, their weight, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec F_T, the tension in the rope, which changes with the angle, θ.\n\n\\vec F, the applied force, which change in magnitude as the angle, θ, changes.\n\nThe forces are illustrated in \n\nFigure 23.\n\n\n\nFigure 23:A free-body diagram of the forces exerted on the child.\n\nThe child is moving at a constant speed, so the net force is equal to zero. The sum of the x and y components of the forces are equal to zero (Newton’s Second Law):\\sum F_x &= F-F_T\\sin\\theta =0\\\\\n\\sum F_y &= F_T\\cos\\theta -mg = 0\n\nRearranging these equations gives:F&=F_T\\sin\\theta\\\\\nmg&=F_T\\cos\\theta\n\nWe want an expression for F that does not depend on F_T (since F_T is unknown), so we can divide one equation by the other:\\frac{F}{mg} &= \\frac{F_T\\sin\\theta}{F_T\\cos\\theta}=\\tan\\theta\\\\\n\\therefore F(\\theta)&=mg\\tan\\theta\n\nwhere we indicated that the force \\vec F(\\theta) depends on the angle θ. The work done by the force, \\vec F, is given by:W_F=\\int_A^B\\vec F(\\theta) \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nd\\vec l is the “path element” along part of the arc of circle over which the child moves, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 24. We have an expression for how \\vec F changes in magnitude as a function of the angle θ, and it would thus be convenient to perform the integral over the angle θ.\n\n\n\nFigure 24:A path element along the circular trajectory of the swing.\n\nWe can use polar coordinate, (r,\\theta), instead of cartesian coordinates to describe the displacement vector, d\\vec l. If the vector subtends an arc on the circle that makes an infinitesimal angle, d\\theta, as illustrated, then the length of the vector d\\vec l is given by:dl = L d\\theta\n\nwhere L is the radius of the circle. The vector d\\vec l makes an angle θ with the horizontal, and thus with the vector, \\vec F. The dot product between \\vec F and d\\vec l can thus be written as:\\vec F(\\theta) \\cdot d\\vec l = Fdl\\cos\\theta=(mg\\tan\\theta)(Ld\\theta)\\cos\\theta=mgL\\sin\\theta d\\theta\n\nWe can now write the integral for the work using limit that are based on the angle θ, from \\theta=0 to \\theta=\\theta_1:W&=\\int_0^{\\theta_1}mgL\\sin\\theta d\\theta\\\\\n&=mgL[-\\cos\\theta]_0^{\\theta_1}=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta_1)\n\nb. We know that the work done by \\vec F is W=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta_1). So, we want to prove that L(1-\\cos\\theta_1) is equal to h. Expanding L(1-\\cos\\theta_1) gives:L(1-\\cos\\theta_1)&=L-L\\cos\\theta_1\n\nThis can be illustrated on a diagram, as in \n\nFigure 25, which shows that h is equal to L-L\\cos\\theta.\n\n\n\nFigure 25:A diagram showing the geometry of the problem\n\nDiscussion: The net force acting on the mass is equal to zero, so the net work must be equal to zero. The two forces that do work on the mass are the applied force \\vec F, and gravity. The work done by the applied force if mgh, so the work done by gravity must be -mgh.","type":"content","url":"/workenergy#solutions","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/potentialecons","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/potentialecons","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/potentialecons#chapter-potentialecons","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"In this chapter, we continue to develop the concept of energy in order to introduce a different formulation for Classical Physics that does not use forces.

As such, this method can be derived from Newton’s formulation, as we will see. Because energy is a scalar quantity, for many problems, it leads to models that are much easier to develop mathematically than if one had used forces. The chapter will conclude with a presentation of the more modern approach, using “Lagrangian Mechanics”, that is currently preferred in physics and forms the basis for extending our description of physics to the microscopic world (e.g. quantum mechanics).\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the difference between conservative and non-conservative forces.\n\nUnderstand how to define potential energy for a conservative force.\n\nUnderstand how to use potential energy to calculate work.\n\nUnderstand the definition of mechanical energy.\n\nUnderstand how to use conservation of mechanical energy.\n\nUnderstand how to apply the Lagrangian formulation in a simple case.\n\nThink About It\n\nThree roller coaster carts start at position x=0,  where they are all at the same height (\n\nFigure 1).

At x_1, Cart B is moving the fastest. This is because Cart B is at the lowest height, so more of its gravitational potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy. At x_2, Cart A and Cart B will be moving at the same speed because they are at the same height. Cart C will only make it to x_2 if it is going fast enough at x=0, since it needs to clear bump that is higher than the height it started at. Cart B will be moving the fastest at x_2 because throughout the duration of the ride, it is at a lower height on average than Cart A, so its gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy sooner and it gets to the end in less time.","type":"content","url":"/potentialecons#chapter-potentialecons","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Conservative forces"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/potentialecons#sec-potentialecons-conservative","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Conservative forces"},"content":"In \n\nChapter 7.1, we introduced the concept of work, W, done by a force, \\vec F(\\vec r), acting on an object as it moves along a path from position A to position B:W = \\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nwhere \\vec F(\\vec r) is a force vector that, in general, is different at different positions in space (\\vec r). We can also say that \\vec F depends on position by writing \\vec F(\\vec r)=\\vec F(x,y,z), since the position vector, \\vec r, is simply the vector \\vec r = x\\hat x + y \\hat y+ z\\hat z. That is, \\vec F(\\vec r) is just a short hand notation for \\vec F(x,y,z), and d\\vec l is a (very) small segment along the particular path over which one calculates the work.\n\nThe above integral is, in general, difficult to evaluate, as it depends on the specific path over which the object moved. In \n\nExample 7.2 of \n\nChapter 7.1, we calculated the work done by friction on a crate that was slid across the floor along two different paths and indeed found that the work depended on the path that was taken. In \n\nExample 7.3 of the same chapter, we saw that the work done by the force of gravity when moving a box along two different paths did not depend on the path chosen.\n\nWe call “conservative forces” those forces for which the work done only depends on the initial and final positions and not on the path taken between those two positions. “Non-conservative” forces are those for which the work done does depend on the path taken. The force of gravity is an example of a conservative force, whereas friction is an example of a non-conservative force.\n\nThis means that the work done by a conservative force on a “closed path” is zero; that is, the work done by a conservative force on an object is zero if the object moves along a path that brings it back to its starting position.\nIndeed, since the work done by a conservative force only depends on the location of the initial and final positions, and not the path taken between them, the work has to be zero if the object ends in the same place as where it started (a possible path is for the object to not move at all).\n\nConsider the work done by gravity in raising (displacement \\vec d_1) and lowering (displacement \\vec d_2=-\\vec d_1) an object back to its starting position along a vertical path, as depicted in \n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:An object that has moved up and back down.\n\nThe total work done by gravity on this particular closed path is easily shown to be zero, as the work can be broken up into the negative work done as the object moves up (displacement vector \\vec d_1) and the positive work done as the object moves down (displacement vector \\vec d_2):W^{tot} = \\vec F_g \\cdot \\vec d_1 + \\vec F_g \\cdot \\vec d_2 = -mgd + mgd = 0\n\nIn order to write the path integral of the force over a closed path, we introduce a new notation to indicate that the starting and ending position are the same:\\int_A^A \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l = \\oint \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nThe condition for a force to be conservative is thus:\\boxed{\\oint \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l = 0}\n\nsince this means that the work done over a closed path is zero. The condition for this integral to be zero can be found by Stokes’ Theorem:\\oint \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l = \\int_S \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat x+ \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat y + \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat z \\right]\\cdot d\\vec A\n\nwhere the integral on the right is called a “surface integral” over the surface, S, enclosed by the closed path over which the work is being calculated. Don’t worry, it is way beyond the scope of this text to understand this integral or Stokes’ Theorem in detail! It is however useful in that it gives us the following conditions on the components of a force for that force to be conservative (by requiring the terms in parentheses to be zero):\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z} &= 0 \\nonumber\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} &= 0\\nonumber\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} &= 0\n\nIn general:\n\nA force can be conservative if it only depends on position in space, and not speed, time, or any other quantity.\n\nA force is conservative if it is constant in magnitude and direction.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nYou push a crate from point A to point B along a horizontal surface.

Note that we have defined the z axis to be vertical and positive upwards.}\n\nSolutions\n\nThe force is expected to be conservative since it is constant in magnitude and direction. We can verify this using the conditions in \n\n(6):\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z} &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}(-mg) - 0 &= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} &= 0 - \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}(-mg) &= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} &= 0 - 0 &=0\n\nand the force is indeed conservative since all three conditions are zero.\n\nExample 8.2\n\nIs the following force conservative?\\vec F(x,y,z) = \\frac{-k}{r^3}\\vec r = \\frac{-kx}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\hat x + \\frac{-ky}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\hat y + \\frac{-kz}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\hat z\n\nSolution\n\nSince the force only depends on position, it could be conservative, so we must check using the conditions from \n\n(6):\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z} &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{-kz}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\left( \\frac{-ky}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{3kz(2y)}{2(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{5}{2}}-\\frac{3ky(2z)}{2(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{5}{2}} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\left(\\frac{-kx}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\left( \\frac{-kz}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{3kx(2z)}{2(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{5}{2}}-\\frac{3kz(2x)}{2(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{5}{2}} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{-ky}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}\\left( \\frac{-kx}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{3ky(2x)}{2(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{5}{2}}-\\frac{3kx(2y)}{2(x^2+y^2+z^2)^\\frac{5}{2}} = 0\n\nwhere we used the Chain Rule to take the derivatives. Since all of the conditions are zero, the force is conservative. As we will see, the force represented here is similar mathematically to both the force that Newton introduced in his Universal Theory of Gravity, and the force introduced by Coulomb as the electric force, which are both conservative.","type":"content","url":"/potentialecons#sec-potentialecons-conservative","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Potential energy"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/potentialecons#potential-energy","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Potential energy"},"content":"In this section, we introduce the concept of “potential energy”. Potential energy is a scalar function of position that can be defined for any conservative force in a way to make it easy to calculate the work done by that force over any path. Since the work done by a conservative force in going from position A to position B does not depend on the particular path taken, but only on the end points, we can write the work done by a conservative force in terms of a “potential energy function”, U(\\vec r), that can be evaluated at the end points:\\boxed{-W = - \\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l = U(\\vec r_B) - U(\\vec r_A) = \\Delta U}\n\nwhere we have have chosen to define the function U(\\vec r) so that it relates to the negative of the work done for reasons that will be apparent in the next section. \n\nFigure 4 shows an example of an arbitrary path between two points A and B in two dimensions for which one could calculate the work done by a conservative force using a potential energy function.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Illustration of calculating the work done by a conservative function along an arbitrary path by taking the difference in potential energy evaluated at the two endpoints, -W=U(\\vec r_B) - U(\\vec r_A).\n\nOnce we know the function for the potential energy, U(\\vec r), we can calculate the work done by the associated force along any path. In order to determine the function, U(\\vec r), we can calculate the work that is done along a path over which the integral for work is easy (usually, a straight line).\n\nFor example, near the surface of the Earth, the force of gravity on an object of mass, m, is given by:\\vec F_g = -mg \\hat z\n\nwhere we have defined the z axis to be vertical and positive upwards. We already showed in \n\nExample 8.1 that this force is conservative and that we can thus define a potential energy function. To do so, we can calculate the work done by the force of gravity over a straight vertical path, from position A to position B, as shown in \n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:A vertical path for calculating the work done by gravity.\n\nThe work done by gravity from position A to position B is:W &= \\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\\\\\n&= \\int_{z_A}^{z_B} ( -mg \\hat z) \\cdot (dz \\hat z) \\\\\n&= -mg \\int_{z_A}^{z_B} dz\\\\\n&= -mg(z_B-z_A)\n\nBy inspection, we can now identify the functional form for the potential energy function, U(\\vec r). We require that:-W &= U(\\vec r_B) - U(\\vec r_A) = U(z_B) - U(z_A)\n\nwhere we replaced the position vector, \\vec r, with the z coordinate, since this is a one dimensional situation. Therefore:-W=mg(z_B-z_A)&= U(z_B) - U(z_A)\\\\\n\\therefore U(z) &= mgz + C\n\nand we have found that, for the force of gravity near the surface of the Earth, one can define a potential energy function (by inspection), U(z) = mgz +C.\n\nIt is important to note that, since it is only the difference in potential energy that matters when calculating the work done, the potential energy function can have an arbitrary constant, C, added to it. Thus, the value of the potential energy function is meaningless, and only differences in potential energy are meaningful and related to the work done on an object. In other words, it does not matter where the potential energy is equal to zero, and by choosing C, we can therefore choose a convenient location where the potential energy is zero.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhen we found the work done by gravity, we defined positive z to be upwards. If we instead chose positive z to be downwards, how would the potential energy function be defined?\n\nThe potential energy function would be the same, U(z)=mgz+C.\n\nThe potential energy function would be the same but negative, U(z)=-mgz+C\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\nCan an object have a negative potential energy?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 8.3\n\nCalculate the work done by the force of gravity when a box of mass, m, is moved from the ground up onto a table that is a distance L away horizontally and H vertically, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 6. How much work must be done by a person moving the box?\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A box moved from the ground up onto a table.\n\nSolution\n\nSince the force of gravity is conservative, we can use the potential energy function given by:U(z)=mgz+C\n\nto calculate the work done by the force of gravity when the box is moved. The work done by gravity will only depend on the change in height, H, as the potential energy function only depends on the z coordinate of an object.  We can choose the origin of our coordinate system to be the ground and choose the constant C=0, so that the potential energy function at the starting position of the box is:U(z_A=0) = mg(0)= 0\n\nThe potential energy function when the box is on the table, with z=H, is given by:U(z_B=H) = mgH\n\nThe change in potential energy, \\Delta U = U(z_B) - U(z_A) is equal to the negative of the work done by gravity. The work done by gravity, W_g, is thus:-W_g &=  U(z_B) - U(z_A) = mgH - 0\\\\\n\\therefore W_g &= -mgH\n\nwhich is the same as what we found in \n\nExample 7.3 of \n\nChapter 7.1. The work done by gravity is negative, as we found previously. This makes sense because gravity has a component opposite to the direction of motion.\n\nThe work done by a person, W_p, to move the box can easily be found by considering the net work done on the box. While the box is moving, only the person and gravity are exerting forces on the box, so those are the only two forces performing work. Since the box starts and ends at rest, the net work done on the box must be zero (no change in kinetic energy, recall the Work-Energy Theorem):W^{net} = 0 &= W_g + W_p\\\\\n\\therefore W_p &= -W_g = mgH\n\nDiscussion: We find that the person had to do positive work, which makes sense, since they had to exert a force with a component in the direction of motion (upwards). It is also interesting to note that it does not matter if the person exerted a constant force or whether they varied the force that they exerted on the box as they moved it: the amount of work done by the person is fixed to be the negative of the work done by gravity.\n\nExample 8.4\n\nThe force exerted by a spring that is extended or compressed by a distance, x, is given by Hooke’s Law:\\vec F(x) = -k x\\hat x\n\nwhere the x axis is defined to be co-linear with the spring and the origin is located at the rest position of the spring. Show that the force exerted by the spring onto an object is conservative and determine the corresponding potential energy function.\n\nSolution\n\nSince the force depends on position, it could be conservative, which we can check with the conditions from \n\n(6):\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z} &= 0 - 0 &= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}(-kx)) - 0&= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} &= 0 - \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}(-kx)) &=0\n\nand the force is indeed conservative. To determine the potential energy function, let us calculate the work done by the spring from position x_A to position x_B:W &=\\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\\\\\n&=\\int_{x_A}^{x_B} (-kx\\hat x) \\cdot dx \\hat x\\\\\n&=\\int_{x_A}^{x_B} (-kx)dx=\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2  \\right]_{x_A}^{x_B}\\\\\n&=-\\left( \\frac{1}{2}kx_B^2-\\frac{1}{2}kx_A^2 \\right)\n\nAgain, comparing with:-W &= U(\\vec r_B) - U(\\vec r_A) = U(x_B) - U(x_A)\n\nWe can identify the potential energy for a spring:U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + C\n\nwhere, in general, the constant C can take any value. If we choose C=0, then the potential energy is zero when the spring is at rest, although it is not important what choice is made. Note that in one dimension, the potential energy function is the negative of the anti-derivative of the function that gives the x component of the force.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA conservative force acts on an object that is initially at rest. No other forces act on the object. Does the object move in a way that increases its potential energy or decreases its potential energy?\n\nIncreases.\n\nDecreases.\n\nIt depends on the choice of C for the corresponding potential energy.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/potentialecons#potential-energy","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl3":"Recovering the force from potential energy","lvl2":"Potential energy"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/potentialecons#sec-potentialecons-forcefromu","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl3":"Recovering the force from potential energy","lvl2":"Potential energy"},"content":"Given a (scalar) potential energy function, U(\\vec r), it is possible to determine the (vector) force that is associated with it.

Generally, the net work done is the sum of the work done by conservative forces, W^C, and the work done by non-conservative forces, W^{NC}:W^{net}=W^C+W^{NC}\n\nThe work done by conservative forces can be expressed in terms of changes in potential energy functions. For example, suppose that two conservative forces, \\vec F_1 and \\vec F_2, are exerted on the object. The work done by those two forces is given by:W_1 &= -\\Delta U_1\\\\\nW_2 &= -\\Delta U_2\n\nwhere U_1 and U_2 are the changes in potential energy associated with forces \\vec F_1 and \\vec F_2, respectively.

In general, we can use \\Delta U to represent the change in the total potential energy of the object. The total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies associated with each of the conservative forces acting on the object (\\Delta U = \\Delta U_1 + \\Delta U_2 above). The above expression can thus be written in a more general form:\\boxed{W^{NC}=\\Delta U + \\Delta K}\n\nIn particular, note that if there are no non-conservative forces doing work on the object:\\boxed{\\Delta K + \\Delta U = 0}\\\\\n-\\Delta U = \\Delta K \\quad\\text{if no non-conservative forces}\n\nThat is, the sum of the changes in potential and kinetic energies of the object is always zero. This means that if the potential energy of the object increases, then the kinetic energy of the object must decrease by the same amount.\n\nWe can introduce the “mechanical energy”, E, of an object as the sum of the potential and kinetic energies of the object:\\boxed{E = U+K}\n\nIf the object started at position A, with potential energy U_A and kinetic energy K_A, and ended up at position B with potential energy U_B and kinetic energy K_B, then we can write the mechanical energy at both positions and its change \\Delta E, as:E_A &= U_A + K_A\\\\\nE_B &= U_B + K_B\\\\\n\\Delta E &= E_B - E_A \\\\\n&= U_B + K_B - U_A - K_A\\\\\n\\therefore \\Delta E &= \\Delta U + \\Delta K\n\nThus, the change in mechanical energy of the object is equal to the work done by non-conservative forces:W^{NC} = \\Delta U + \\Delta K = \\Delta E\n\nand if there is no work done by non-conservative forces on the object, then the mechanical energy of the object does not change:\\Delta E &= 0\\quad\\text{if no non-conservative forces}\\\\\n\\therefore E &= \\text{constant}\n\nThis is what we generally call the “conservation of mechanical energy”. If there are no non-conservative forces doing work on an object, its mechanical energy is conserved (i.e. constant).\n\nThe introduction of mechanical energy gives us a completely different way to think about mechanics. We can now think of an object as having “energy” (potential and/or kinetic), and we can think of forces as changing the energy of the object.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIs the value of an an object’s mechanical energy meaningful, or is it only the difference in mechanical energy that is meaningful?\n\nYes, the value of the mechanical energy is meaningful. At any given time, an object will have a quantifiable amount of mechanical energy.\n\nNo, the value is not meaningful because the value of potential energy is arbitrary. Only differences in mechanical energy are meaningful.\n\nNo, the value is not meaningful because both the potential and kinetic energies are arbitrary. Their values will change depending on where you set the energy to be zero.\n\nIt depends on which conservative forces act on the object (and therefore what “kind” of potential energy the object has).\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nWe can also think of the work done by non-conservative forces as a type of change in energy. For example, the work done by friction can be thought of as a change in thermal energy (feel the burn as you rub your hand vigorously on a table!). If we can model the work done by non-conservative forces as a type of “other” energy, -W^{NC}=\\Delta E^{other}, then we can state that:\\Delta E^{other} + \\Delta U + \\Delta K =0\n\nwhich is what we usually refer to as “conservation of energy”. That is, the total energy in a system, including kinetic, potential and any other form (e.g. thermal, electrical, etc.) is constant unless some external agent is acting on the system.\n\nWe can always include that external agent in the system so that the total energy of the system is constant. The largest system that we can have is the Universe itself. Thus, the total energy in the Universe is constant and can only transform from one type into another, but no energy can ever be added or removed from the Universe.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nHere’s an example that may help you understand the concept of external agents and energy conservation. Say we have a mass that hangs from a spring, so that the mass oscillates up and down like a yo-yo. If we define our system to include the spring, the mass, and gravity, energy will be conserved (the energy is transformed from potential energy to kinetic energy and back again).\n\nNow, what if someone is holding the end of the spring and they start walking so that the whole system accelerates? Energy is not conserved because the system is gaining kinetic energy, seemingly out of nowhere. The system is being acted on by an external agent (the person). If we expand our system so that it includes the spring, the mass, gravity, and the person, energy is conserved. Instead of the kinetic energy “coming out of nowhere”, we can see that it is actually coming from the person converting chemical energy in their body in order to move their muscles.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A person accelerates a mass and spring by walking. If the system does not include the person, energy is not conserved. If it does include the person, energy is conserved.\n\nBut what if there’s an external agent acting on our new system? We can keep “zooming out” to include more and more external sources in the definition of our system. If you kept zooming out, eventually you would reach the point where the whole Universe was included in your system. At this point, you can’t zoom out any more. This means that, if the Universe is your system, energy must always be conserved because there can’t be any external agents acting on the system.\n\nExample 8.5\n\n\n\nFigure 8:A block is launched along a frictionless surface by compressing a spring by a distance D. The top panel shows the spring when at rest, and the bottom panel shows the spring compressed by a distance D just before releasing the block.\n\nA block of mass m can slide along a horizontal frictionless surface. A horizontal spring, with spring constant, k, is attached to a wall on one end, while the other end can move, as shown in \n\nFigure 8. A coordinate system is defined such that the x axis is horizontal and the free end of the spring is at x=0 when the spring is at rest. The block is pushed against the spring so that the spring is compressed by a distance D. The block is then released. What speed will the block have when it leaves the spring?\n\nSolution\n\nThis is again the same example that we saw in \n\nChapter 6.1 and \n\nChapter 7.1. We will show here that it is solved very easily using conservation of energy. The forces acting on the block are:\n\nWeight, which does no work since it is perpendicular to the block’s displacement.\n\nThe normal force, which does no work since it is perpendicular to the block’s displacement.\n\nThe force from the spring, which is conservative and can be modelled with a potential energy U(x)=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2, where x is the position of the end of the spring.\n\nThe block starts at rest at position A (x=-D), where the spring is compressed by a distance D, and leaves the spring at position B (x=0), where the spring is at its rest position.\n\nAt position A, the kinetic energy of the block is K_A=0 since the block is at rest, and the potential energy from the spring force of the block is U_A=\\frac{1}{2}kD^2. The mechanical energy of the block at position A is thus:K_A&=0\\\\\nU_A&=\\frac{1}{2}kD^2\\\\\n\\therefore E_A &= U_A + K_A = \\frac{1}{2}kD^2\n\nAt position B, the spring potential energy of the block is zero (since the spring is at rest), and all of the energy is kinetic:K_B&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2\\\\\nU_B&=0\\\\\n\\therefore E_B &= U_B+K_B=\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2\n\nSince there are no non-conservative forces doing work on the block, the mechanical energies at A and B are the same:W^{NC}&=\\Delta E=E_B-E_A= 0\\\\\n\\therefore E_B&=E_A\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2&= \\frac{1}{2}kD^2\\\\\n v_B &= \\sqrt{\\frac{kD^2}{m}}\n\nas we found previously.\n\nExample 8.6\n\n\n\nFigure 9:A block slides down an incline before sliding on a flat surface and stopping.\n\nA block of mass m is placed at rest on an incline that makes an angle θ with respect to the horizontal, as shown in \n\nFigure 9. The block is nudged slightly so that the force of static friction is overcome and the block starts to accelerate down the incline. At the bottom of the incline, the block slides on a horizontal surface.\nThe coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is \\mu_{k1}, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and horizontal surface is \\mu_{k2}. If one assumes that the block started at rest a distance L from the bottom of the incline, how far along the horizontal surface will the block slide before stopping?\n\nSolution\n\nThis is the same problem we solved in this \n\nExample. In that case, we solved for the acceleration of the block using Newton’s Second Law and then used kinematics to find how far the block went. We can solve this problem in a much easier way using conservation of energy.\n\nIt is still a good idea to think about what forces are applied on the object in order to determine if there are non-conservative forces doing work. In this case, the forces on the block are:\n\nThe normal force, which does no work, as it is always perpendicular to the motion.\n\nWeight, which does work when the height of the object changes, which we can model with a potential energy function.\n\nFriction, which is a non-conservative force, whose work we must determine.\n\nLet us divide the motion into two segments: (1) a segment along the incline (positions A to B in \n\nFigure 9), where gravitational potential energy changes, and (2), the horizontal segment from positions B to position C on the figure. We can then apply conservation of energy for each segment.\n\nStarting with the first segment, we can choose the gravitational potential energy to be zero when the block is at the bottom of the incline. The block starts at a height h=L\\sin\\theta above the  bottom of the incline. The gravitational potential energy for the beginning and end of the first segment are thus:U_A &= mgL\\sin\\theta\\\\\nU_B &= 0\n\nSince the block starts at rest, its kinetic energy is zero at position A, and if the speed of the box is v_B at position B, we can write its kinetic energy at both positions as:K_A &=0\\\\\nK_B &= \\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2\n\nThe mechanical energy of the object at positions A and B is thus:E_A &= U_A+K_A = mgL\\sin\\theta\\\\\nE_B &= U_B+K_B = \\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2\\\\\n\\Delta E &= E_B - E_A = \\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2 - mgL\\sin\\theta\n\nFinally, since we have a non-conservative force, the force of kinetic friction, acting on the first segment, we need to calculate the work done by that force. We found in \n\nExample 6.2 that the force of friction had magnitude f_k=\\mu_{k1}N=\\mu_{k1}mg\\cos\\theta. Since the force of friction is anti-parallel to the displacement vector, which points down the incline and has length L, the work done by friction is:W^{NC}=W_f = -f_kL=-\\mu_{k1}mg\\cos\\theta L\n\nApplying conservation of energy along the first segment, we have:W^{NC} &= \\Delta E\\\\\n-\\mu_{k1}mg\\cos\\theta L &= \\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2 - mgL\\sin\\theta\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2 &= mgL\\sin\\theta-\\mu_{k1}mg\\cos\\theta L\n\nNote that the above equation, in words, could be read as, “the change in kinetic energy (\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2) is equal to the negative change in potential energy (mgL\\sin\\theta) minus the work done by friction (\\mu_{k1}mg\\cos\\theta L)”. In other words, the block had potential energy, which was converted into kinetic energy and heat (the work done by friction can be thought of as thermal energy).\n\nWe now proceed in an analogous way for the second segment, from position B to position C. The only force that can do work along this segment (of length x) is the force of kinetic friction, since both the weight and normal force are perpendicular to the displacement. There are no conservative forces doing work, so there is no change in potential energy. The initial kinetic energy is K_B (from above), and the final kinetic energy, K_C, is zero. The change in mechanical energy is thus:\\Delta E &= E_C - E_B = K_C - K_B = -K_B\\\\\n&=-\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2\\\\\n&=- mgL\\sin\\theta+\\mu_{k1}mg\\cos\\theta L\n\nwhere, in the last line, we used the result from the first segment. The work done by the force of friction along the horizontal segment of (undetermined) length x is:W^{NC}=W_f = -f_kx = -\\mu_{k2} N x=-\\mu_{k2} mg x\n\nFinally, we can find x by setting the work done by non-conservative forces equal to the change in mechanical energy:W^{NC} &= \\Delta E\\\\\n-\\mu_{k2} mg x &=- mgL\\sin\\theta+\\mu_{k1}mg\\cos\\theta L \\\\\n\\therefore x&= L\\frac{1}{\\mu_{k2}}\\left(\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{k1}\\cos\\theta\\right)\n\nwhich is the same result that we obtained in \n\nExample 6.2.\n\nDiscussion: By using conservation of energy, we were able to model the motion of the block down the incline in a way that was much easier than what was done in \n\nExample 6.2. Furthermore, although we modelled friction as a non-conservative force doing work, we gained some insight into the idea that this could be thought of as an energy loss. In terms of energy, we would say that the block initially had gravitational potential energy, which was then converted into kinetic energy as well as thermal energy (in the heat generated by friction).","type":"content","url":"/potentialecons#mechanical-energy-and-conservation-of-energy","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Energy diagrams and equilibria"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/potentialecons#sec-potentialecons-ediagrams","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Energy diagrams and equilibria"},"content":"We can write the mechanical energy of an object as:E = K + U\n\nwhich will be a constant if there are no non-conservative forces doing work on the object. This means that if the potential energy of the object increases, then its kinetic energy must decrease by the same amount, and vice-versa.\n\nConsider a block that can slide on a frictionless horizontal surface and that is attached to a spring, as is shown in \n\nFigure 10 (left side), where x=0 is chosen as the position corresponding to the rest length of the spring. If you push on the block so as to compress the spring by a distance D and then release it, the block will initially accelerate because of the spring force in the positive x direction until the block reaches the rest position of the spring (x=0 on the diagram). When it passes that point, the spring will exert a force in the opposite direction. The block will continue in the same direction and decelerate until it stops and turns around. It will then accelerate again towards the rest position of the spring, and then decelerate once the spring starts being compressed again, until the block stops and the motion repeats. We say that the block “oscillates” back and forth about the rest position of the spring.\n\nWe can describe the motion of the block in terms of its total mechanical energy, E. Its potential energy is given by:U(x)=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\nOn the right of \n\nFigure 10 is an “Energy Diagram” for the block, which allows us to examine how the total energy, E, of the block is divided between kinetic and potential energy depending on the position of the block. The vertical axis corresponds to energy and the horizontal axis corresponds to the position of the block.\n\nThe total mechanical energy, E=25 {\\rm J}, is shown by the horizontal red line. Also illustrated are the potential energy function (U(x) in blue), and the kinetic energy, (K=E-U(x), in dotted black).\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Left: The block oscillates about the rest position of the spring, between x=-D and x=D. Right: The energy diagram for the block. This diagram is for a spring with spring constant k=1 {\\rm N/m}.\n\nThe energy diagram allows us to describe the motion of the object attached to the spring in terms of energy. A few things to note:\n\nAt x=\\pm D, the potential energy is equal to E, so the kinetic energy is zero. The block is thus instantaneously at rest at those positions.\n\nAt x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximal. This corresponds to where the block has the highest speed.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the block can never be negative, thus, the block cannot be located outside the range [-D,+D], and we would say that the motion of the block is “bound”. The points between which the motion is bound are called “turning points”.\n\nAn analysis of the energy diagram tells us that the block is bound between the two turning points, which themselves are equidistant from the origin. When we initially compress the spring, we are “giving” the block “spring potential energy”. As the block starts to move, the potential energy of the block is converted into kinetic energy as it accelerates and then back into potential energy as it decelerates.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nCalculate the positions of the turning points for the situation shown in \n\nFigure 10. The total energy is 25 {\\rm J} and the spring constant is k=1 {\\rm N/m}.\n\nAnswer\n\n7.1 {\\rm m}\n\nBy looking at only the potential energy function, without knowing that it is related to a spring, we can come to the same conclusions; namely that the motion is bound as long as the total mechanical energy is not infinite. We call the point x=0 a “stable equilibrium”, because it is a local minimum of the potential energy function. If the object is displaced from the equilibrium point, it will want to move back towards that point. This can also be understood in terms of the force associated with the potential energy function:F = -\\frac{d}{dx}U(x)\n\nThe local minimum occurs where the derivative of the potential function is equal to zero. Thus, the equilibrium point is given by the condition that the force associated with the potential is zero (x=0 in the case of the potential energy from a spring). The equilibrium is a stable equilibrium because the force associated with the potential energy function (F(x)=-kx for the spring) points towards the equilibrium point.\n\nThe potential energy function for an object with total mechanical energy, E, can be thought of as a little “roller coaster”, on which you place a marble and watch it “roll down” the potential energy function. You can think of placing a marble where U(x)=E and releasing it. The marble would then roll down the potential energy function, just as an actual marble would roll down a real slope, mimicking the motion of the object along the x axis. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 11 which shows an arbitrary potential energy function and a marble being placed at a location where the potential energy is equal to E.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:Arbitrary potential energy function and illustration of visualizing a marble rolling down the function by placing the marble on the potential energy function at a point where U(x)=E.\n\nThe motion of the marble will be bound between the two points where the potential energy function is equal to E. When the marble is placed as shown, it will roll towards the left, just as if it were a real marble on a track. Since the potential energy is increasing as a function of x at the point where we placed the marble, the force is in the negative x direction (remember, the force is the negative of the derivative of the potential energy function). With the given energy, the marble would never be able to make it to point D, as it does not have enough energy to “climb up the hill”. It would roll down, through point C, up to point B, down to point A, and then turn around where U(x)=E and return to where it started.\n\nLocations A and C on the diagram are stable equilibria, because if a marble is placed in one of those locations and nudged slightly, it will come back to the equilibrium point (or oscillate about that point). Points B and D are “unstable equilibria”, because if the marble is placed there and nudged, it will not immediately come back to those points. Note that if the marble were placed at point D and nudged towards the right, the motion of the marble would be unbound on the right, and it would keep going in that direction.\n\nNow, say an object’s potential energy is described by the function in \n\nFigure 11, and the object has total energy E. The object’s motion along the x axis will be exactly the same as the projection of the marble’s motion on the x axis.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA force, F(x), acts on an object. The potential energy function, U(x), associated with the force is given by U(x)=a(x-6)^2(x-1)(x-3)+20 {\\rm J}, where a is a positive constant. U(x) is plotted in \n\nFigure 12. Use the “marble” method to determine the direction of the force at x=5. Confirm your answer by finding the value of the force , F(x), at x=5.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:A potential energy function U(x).

A lot of research was done in the eighteenth century to reformulate a theory of mechanics that would be equivalent to Newton’s Theory but whose starting point is the concept of energy instead of the concept of force. This “modern” approach to classical mechanics is primarily based on the research by Lagrange and Hamilton.\n\nAlthough it is beyond the scope of this text to go into the details of this formulation, it is worth taking a quick look in order to get a better sense of how physicists seek to generalize theories. It is also worth noting that the Lagrangian formulation is the method by which theories are developed for quantum mechanics and modern physics.\n\nThe Lagrangian description of a “system” is based on a quantity, L, called the “Lagrangian”, which is defined as:\\boxed{L = K - U}\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy of the system, and U is its potential energy. A “system” can be a rather complex collection of objects, although we will illustrate how the Lagrangian formulation is implemented for a single object of mass m moving in one dimension under the influence of gravity. Let x be the direction of motion (which is vertical) such that the potential and kinetic energies of the object are given by:U(x) &= mgx\\\\\nK(v_x) &= \\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2\\\\\n\\therefore L(x,v_x) &= \\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 - mgx\n\nwhere we chose the potential energy to be zero at x=0, and v_x is the velocity of the object.\n\nIn the modern formulation of classical mechanics, the motion of the system will be such that the following integral is minimized:S = \\int Ldt\n\nwhere L can depend on time explicitly or implicitly (through the fact that position and velocity, on which the Lagrangian depends, are themselves time-dependent). The requirement that the above integral be minimized is called the “Principle of Least Action”, and is thought to be the fundamental principle that describes all of the laws of physics. The condition for the action to be minimized is given by the Euler-Lagrange equation:\\boxed{\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0}\n\nThus, in the Lagrangian formulation, one first writes down the Lagrangian for the system, and then uses the Euler-Lagrange equation to obtain the “equations of motion” for the system (i.e. equation that give the kinematic quantities, such as acceleration, for the system).\n\nGiven the Lagrangian that we found above for a particle moving in one dimension under the influence of gravity, we can determine each term in the Euler-Lagrange equation:\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x} &= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial v_x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 - mgx \\right)=mv_x\\\\\n\\therefore\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right) &= \\frac{d}{dt} (mv_x) = ma_x\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}&= \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 - mgx\\right) = -mg\\\\\n\nPutting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation:\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} &= 0\\\\\n(ma_x) - (-mg) &=0\\\\\nma_x&=-mg\\\\\n\\therefore a_x &= -g\n\nwhich is exactly equivalent to using Newton’s Second Law (the second last step is equivalent to F=ma). In the Lagrangian formulation, we do not need the concept of force. Instead, we describe possible “interactions” by a potential energy function. That is why you may sometimes hear of physicists talking about the “Weak interaction” instead of the “Weak force” when they are talking about one of the four fundamental interactions (forces) of Nature. This is because, in the modern formulation of physics, one does not use the concept of force, and instead thinks of potential energy functions to model what we would call a force in the Newtonian approach.\n\nEmmy Noether, a mathematician in the early twentieth century, proved a theorem that makes the Lagrangian formulation particularly aesthetic.\nNoether’s theorem states that for any symmetry in the Lagrangian, there exists a quantity that is conserved. For example, if the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time, then a quantity, which we call energy, is conserved.\n\nThe Lagrangian that we had above for a particle moving under the influence of gravity did not depend on time explicitly, and thus energy is conserved (gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and there are no non-conservative forces). If the Lagrangian did not depend on position, then a quantity that we call “momentum” would be conserved. In this case, momentum in the x direction was not conserved because the Lagrangian depended on x through the potential energy.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nWe saw in this chapter that describing systems in terms of energy is often easier than describing them in terms of forces. The Lagrangian gives us a way to get the same information we would get from Newton’s laws (like the acceleration, etc.), but using energy as a starting point. The Lagrangian method is really useful when we are looking at motion in multiple dimensions, or when we are describing complicated systems. Using the Lagrangian is actually really simple, and just like with forces, you can pretty much approach every problem the same way. Here are the basic steps to follow:\n\nFind two expressions for your system: one for the potential energy (U) and one for the kinetic energy (K). This often ends up being the hardest step.\n\nWrite down the Lagrangian, L=K-U, using the expressions you just found.\n\nPick a coordinate. (In one dimension, this is trivial, but it will be important once you start working in multiple dimensions). The Euler-Lagrange equation was given to you as:\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n\nbecause we are working in one dimension. You can actually pick whichever coordinate you are interested in. For example, if you were interested in the motion of your object in the y direction, you would pick y as your coordinate and write:\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_y}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 0\n\nNow you just have to do what the equation above tells you to do, which is to start with your Lagrangian (your L=K-U equation) and take a bunch of derivatives. If you try to just plug L into the Euler-Lagrange equation and do all the derivatives at once, it can get confusing. I recommend finding the components separately. I like to start by taking the partial derivative with respect to velocity, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_y}, then taking its derivative with respect to time. Next, I find \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} and then put it all together.\n\nThat’s it! When you’ve taken the derivatives (and simplified a bit), you’ll have an “equation of motion” that gives you information about the motion of the object. You can then use this equation however you want!","type":"content","url":"/potentialecons#advanced-topic-the-lagrangian-formulation-of-classical-physics","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/potentialecons#summary","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 8 - Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"A force is conservative if the work done by that force on a closed path is zero:\\oint \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l = 0\n\nEquivalently, the force is conservative if the work done by the force on an object moving from position A to position B does not depend on the particular path between the two points.

In other words, we are free to choose the location in space where the potential energy function is defined to be zero.\n\nWe can break up the net work done on an object as the sum of the work done by conservative (W^C) and non-conservative forces (W^{NC}):W^{net}&=W^{NC}+W^{C}=W^{NC}-\\Delta U\n\nwhere \\Delta U is the difference in the total potential energy of the object (the sum of the potential energies for each conservative force acting on the object).\n\nThe Work-Energy Theorem states that the net work done on an object in going from position A to position B is equal to the object’s change in kinetic energy:W^{net}&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2-\\frac{1}{2}mv_A^2=\\Delta K\n\nWe can thus write that the total work done by non conservative forces is equal to the change in potential and kinetic energies:W^{NC}=\\Delta K+\\Delta U\n\nIn particular, if no non-conservative forces do work on an object, then the change in total potential energy is equal to the negative of the change in kinetic energy of the object:-\\Delta U=\\Delta K\n\nWe can introduce the mechanical energy, E, of an object as:E = U+K\n\nThe net work done by non-conservative forces is then equal to the change in the object’s mechanical energy:W^{NC}=\\Delta E\n\nIn particular, if no net work is done on the object by non-conservative forces, then the mechanical energy of the object does not change (\\Delta E=0). In this case, we say that the mechanical energy of the object is conserved.\n\nThe Lagrangian description of classical mechanics is based on the Lagrangian, L:L = K - U\n\nwhich is the difference between the kinetic energy, K, and the potential energy, U, of the object. The equations of motion are given by the Principle of Least Action, which leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation (written here for the case of a particle moving in one dimension):\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n\nImportant Equations\n\nConditions for a force to be conservative:\\oint \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l = 0\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z} &= 0 \\nonumber\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} &= 0\\nonumber\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} &= 0\n\nPotential energy for a conservative force:\\Delta U&=-W\\\\\nU(\\vec r_B) - U(\\vec r_A)&= - \\int_A^B \\vec F(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nWork-energy theorem:W^{net}&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2-\\frac{1}{2}mv_A^2=\\Delta K\n\nWork:W^{net}&=W^{NC}+W^{C}=W^{NC}-\\Delta U\\\\\nW^{NC}&=\\Delta K+\\Delta U\n\nEnergy:E&=U+K\\\\\nW^{NC}&=\\Delta E\n\nLagrange:L = K - U\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n\nImportant Definitions\n\nConservative force: A force that does no net work when exerted over a closed path.\n\nPotential energy: A form of energy that an object has by virtue of its position in space.

Both are conservative, so we can use conservation of mechanical energy. We will find the energy of the ball when it is at a height h above the spring, and the energy of the ball when the spring is fully compressed. Then, we will use conservation of mechanical energy to determine the compression of the spring.\n\nRemember that the total mechanical energy is the sum of the total potential energy and the kinetic energy, E=U+K. Let’s call the initial position of the ball A and the final position of the ball B. You will notice that we set up our coordinate system so that y is positive upwards, with y=0 at the point where the ball comes into contact with the spring. We choose to define both the gravitational potential energy and spring potential energy so that they are zero at y=0.\n\nSince the ball starts from rest, its kinetic energy is zero at position A. At this point, the ball is not touching the spring, so the potential energy from the spring force is zero. The mechanical energy of the ball at position A is simply equal to its gravitational potential energy:E_A&=U_A+K_A\\\\\nE_A&=mgh\n\nAt position B, the ball is again at rest, so the kinetic energy of the ball is zero. Now that the ball is in contact with the spring, it will experience a force from the spring that can be modelled with a potential energy U(y)=\\frac{1}{2}ky_1^2, where y_1 is the distance between the rest position of the spring and its compressed length. At point B (y=-y_1), the ball will have both spring and gravitational potential energy, so its mechanical energy at position B is given by:E_B&=U_B+K_B=U_B\\\\\nU_B&=mg(-y_1)+\\frac{1}{2}ky_1^2\\\\\nE_B&=-mgy_1+\\frac{1}{2}ky_1^2\n\nSince mechanical energy is conserved in this system (no non-conservative forces are doing work), we can now set E_A=E_B and solve for y_1:E_A&=E_B\\\\\nmgh&=-mgy_1+\\frac{1}{2}ky_1^2\\\\\n0&=\\frac{1}{2}ky_1^2-mgy_1-mgh\\\\\n\nwhere in the last line we rewrote the expression as a quadratic equation. We can solve for y_1 with the quadratic formula:y_1=\\frac{mg\\pm\\sqrt{(mg)^2-4(1/2k)(-mgh)}}{k}\\\\\ny_1=\\frac{mg\\pm\\sqrt{mg(mg+2kh)}}{k}\n\nWe now have an expression for the amount the spring is compressed, y_1, in terms of our known values.\n\nSolution 8.2\n\nWe are going to find a general expression for the energy of the system, and then use this expression to find the velocity at any point. There are two forces acting on the mass:\n\nThe force of tension (from the string). This force is perpendicular to the direction of motion at any point, so it does no work on the mass.\n\nThe force of gravity, which has a potential energy function given by U(y)=mgy. We choose the gravitational potential energy to be zero when the pendulum hangs vertically (when \\theta=0 and y=0).\n\nThe mechanical energy of the mass is conserved, and at any point is given by the sum of its kinetic and its gravitational potential energies:E=mgy+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\nWe want to find the velocity as a function of θ, so we need to write y in terms of θ. As you may recall from \n\nProblem 7.2, we saw that from the geometry of the problem, we can express the height of the mass as y=L-L\\cos\\theta, or L(1-\\cos\\theta), where y is the height as measured from the bottom point of the motion. You can refer to \n\nFigure 25 to refresh your memory. The energy at any point is then:E=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta)+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\nConservation of energy tells us that the total energy at any point must be the same as the initial energy. So, we can use our initial conditions to find the total energy of the system. The mass starts from rest (initial kinetic energy is zero) an angle \\theta_0 above the vertical:E&=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta)+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\\\\nE_{initial}&=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta_0)\n\nNow that we have found the total energy of the system, we can write our general expression for the energy of the system at any point:E&=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta)+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\\\\nmgL(1-\\cos\\theta_0)&=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta)+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\nAll that’s left to do is simplify the expression and rearrange for v:mgL(1-\\cos\\theta_0)&=mgL(1-\\cos\\theta)+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\\\\ngL(1-\\cos\\theta_0)-gL(1-\\cos\\theta)&=\\frac{1}{2}v^2\\\\\ngL-gL\\cos\\theta_0-gL+gL\\cos\\theta&=\\frac{1}{2}v^2\\\\\ngL(\\cos\\theta-\\cos\\theta_0)&=\\frac{1}{2}v^2\\\\\n\\therefore v&=\\sqrt{2gl(\\cos\\theta-\\cos\\theta_0)}\n\nDiscussion: We can see from this expression that the speed will be maximized when \\cos\\theta is maximized, which will occur when \\theta=0 (when the pendulum is vertical). This is as we expected. We can also see that we will get an imaginary number if the magnitude of θ is greater than \\theta_0, showing that the motion is constrained between -\\theta_0 and \\theta_0. Finally, we showed that the velocity of the pendulum does not depend on the mass!\n\nSolution 8.3\n\nWe are going to find an equation of motion of the system using the Lagrangian method. We choose to use a one dimension coordinate system, with the x axis defined to be co-linear with the spring, positive in the direction where the spring is extended, and set the origin to be located at the rest position of the spring. The kinetic energy and potential energy of the mass are given byK&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2\\\\\nU&=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\nsince the only force exerted on the mass that can do work is the force from the spring. We have chosen the potential energy to be zero at x=0. The Lagrangian for this system is:L&=K-U\\\\\nL&=\\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation in one dimension is:\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n\nWe can calculate the terms of the Euler-Lagrange equation:\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}&=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial v_x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\right)\\\\\n&=mv_x\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)&=\\frac{d}{dt}(mv_x)\\\\\n&=ma_x\\\\\n\\textrm{and}\\qquad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}&=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\right)\\\\\n&=-kx\n\nand then put them together to get:\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v_x}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} &= 0\\\\\n\\therefore ma_x&=-kx\\\\\n\nWe can see that this equation of motion is equivalent to Newton’s Second Law.\n\nAt least for those two paths that we tried in the example.\n\nAs you may recall from \n\nAppendix 1.1, the gradient is a vector that points towards the direction of maximal increase in a multi-variate function.\n\nThis is why we defined potential energy as negative of the work; it becomes a positive term when we move it to the same side of the equation as the kinetic energy!\n\nRemember, the kinetic energy is given by K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^2. Since neither mass nor the value of v^2 can be negative, the kinetic energy of an object can never be negative.\n\nThe integral, S, is called the “action” of the system.\n\nIf the Lagrangian does not depend on time, then we can shift the system in time and the equations of motion would be unaffected. We say that the Lagrangian is symmetric, or unaffected, by changes in time.\n\nSee \n\nChapter %s.","type":"content","url":"/potentialecons#solutions","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/gravity","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/gravity","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gravity#chapter-gravity","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"In previous chapters, we have so far learned about Newton’s Theory of Classical Mechanics, which allowed us to model the motion of an object based on the forces acting on the object.

Because the points C and D are further away from the Sun than points A and B, the distance between points C and D must be smaller than the distance between points A and B for the two areas to be the same. This, in turn, implies that the planet must be moving slower between C and D than between points A and B. The speed of a planet is thus greatest at the perihelion and smallest at the aphelion.

It is rather remarkable that Newton was able to make the connection between falling apples and the motion of the moon around the Earth to find a single theory to describe both situations.\n\nWe should be clear that the theory of gravity is a different theory than Newton’s “Laws of Motion” (Newton’s Three Laws). The Laws of Motion introduce the concepts of force and inertial mass, and prescribe how to use those concepts in order to model motion using kinematics. Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity is a theory that describes the force of gravity that two bodies with (gravitational) mass exert on each other.\n\nNewton’s Universal Theory of Gravity states that if two bodies, with masses M_1 and M_2, located at positions \\vec r_1 and \\vec r_2, respectively, are separated by a distance, r, then M_2 will exert an attractive force on M_1, \\vec F_{12}, given by:\\vec F_{12}=-G\\frac{M_1M_2}{r^2}\\hat r_{21}\n\nwhere \\hat r_{21} is the unit vector from M_2 to M_1:\\vec r_{21} &= \\vec r_2 - \\vec r_1\\\\\n\\hat r_{21} &= \\frac{1}{r} \\vec r_{21}\n\nas shown in \n\nFigure 5. \\vec F_{12} should be read as “the force on body 1 from body 2”. G=6.67\\times 10^{-11} {\\rm Nm^2/kg^2} is Newton’s Universal Constant of Gravity. It should be noted that Newton’s theory for the force of gravity written in this form only applies to either point masses (separated by a distance r) or spherical bodies whose centres are separated by a distance r that is larger than the radius of either sphere.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Illustration of the vectors involved in Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity.\n\nOriginally, Newton argued that the force of gravity would be proportional to the masses of the bodies, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:F_{12}\\propto \\frac{M_1M_2}{r^2}\n\nand G is simply the constant of proportionality.\n\nBecause of Newton’s Third Law, body 1 exerts a force on body 2 that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction:\\vec F_{12} = -\\vec F_{21}\n\nExample 9.1\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the force of gravity between yourself and a person standing 50 {\\rm cm} from you and compare that to your weight at the surface of the Earth (the force of gravity exerted by the Earth on you).}\n\nSolution\n\nIf we assume that the two people have a mass of 50 {\\rm kg}, the force of gravity exerted by one on the other, if they are separated by 50 {\\rm cm}, is given by:F&=G\\frac{M_1M_2}{r^2}\\\\\n&=(6.67\\times 10^{-11} {\\rm Nm^2/kg^2})\\frac{(50 {\\rm kg})(50 {\\rm kg})}{(0.5 {\\rm m})^2}\\\\\n&=6.67\\times 10^{-7} {\\rm N}\n\nThis is a very small force, compared to their weight, F_g:F_g&=M_1g\\\\\n&=(50 {\\rm kg})(9.8 {\\rm N/kg})\\\\\n&=490 {\\rm N}\n\nwhich is approximately 700 million times bigger.\n\nDiscussion: The force of gravity is a very weak force when compared to other forces in Nature, such as the electric force between two charges. Newton’s Universal Constant of Gravity is very small, so the force of gravity between two objects is very small unless either of the masses involved are very large, or the distance between them is very small. In general, when modelling the motion of objects on the Earth, it is generally safe to ignore the forces of gravity between objects and only include their weight (the force of gravity from the Earth).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nThe radius of the Earth is 6371 {\\rm km}.

The semi-major axis of the orbit is equal to the radius of the orbit for a circular orbit (s=R).\n\nIf the planet is in a circular orbit about the Sun, its speed, v, will be constant, by Kepler’s Second Law, and it will thus be executing uniform circular motion. The only force exerted on the planet is the force of gravity exerted by the Sun. Thus the force of gravity must be equal to the mass of the planet times its radial (centripetal) acceleration, a_R, which is given by:a_R=\\frac{v^2}{R}\n\nNewton’s Second Law for the planet can be written as:\\sum F = F_g &= ma_R\\\\\nG\\frac{Mm}{R^2}&=m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\nG\\frac{M}{R}&=v^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the Sun. The speed of the planet is given by the circumference of the orbit divided by the orbital period T, since it is constant:v=\\frac{2\\pi R}{T}\n\nRe-arranging the equation from Newton’s Second Law:G\\frac{M}{R}&=v^2\\\\\nG\\frac{M}{R}&=\\frac{4\\pi^2 R^2}{T^2}\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{R^3}{T^2}&=G\\frac{M}{4\\pi^2}\n\nThus, we find that the ratio of the cube of the orbital radius to the period squared is a constant that depends only on the mass of the Sun, which will then be the same for all planets (as it does not depend on, say, the mass of the planet that we considered).\n\nDiscussion: The relation above can, for example, be used to determine the mass of the Sun, since we can use geometry to determine the semi-major axis for the orbit of a planet, as Kepler did with the data from Tycho Brahe.\n\nExample 9.3\n\nThe acceleration due to Earth’s gravity depends on the force that the Earth exerts on an object. Using the Earth’s mass and radius, determine the acceleration of falling objects due to Earth’s gravity at the surface of the Earth. Also, determine the altitude where the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity is half of that at the Earth’s surface.\n\nSolution\n\nWe can find the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity by determining the acceleration of a mass m upon which gravity is the only acting force. In other words, we model an object that is in free-fall a distance R away from the centre of the Earth. Newton’s Second Law can be used in one dimension (corresponding to the direction that connects the falling mass to the centre of the Earth):\\sum F &= G\\frac{Mm}{R^2}=ma\\\\\n\\therefore a&=G\\frac{M}{R^2}\n\nwhere M=5.97\\times 10^{24} {\\rm kg} is the mass of the Earth. At the surface of the Earth, R=R_\\oplus=6.371\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m}:a&=G\\frac{M}{R_\\oplus^2}=(6.67\\times 10^{-11} {\\rm Nm^2/kg^2})\\frac{(5.97\\times 10^{24} {\\rm kg})}{(6.371\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m})^2}\\\\\n&=9.81 {\\rm m/s^2}\n\nwhich, of course, is the value of g that we have been using so far for the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the Earth. To find the altitude at which this is reduced by half, we first find the value of R that corresponds to this acceleration:\\frac{1}{2}G\\frac{M}{R_\\oplus^2}&=G\\frac{M}{R^2}\\\\\n\\therefore R &=\\sqrt{2}R_\\oplus = 9.0\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m}\n\nwhich corresponds to an altitude of h=R-R_\\oplus=2640 {\\rm km}, well above the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nDiscussion: The acceleration of falling objects decreases as one moves further from the centre of the Earth. It is thus an approximation to assume that g is a constant, although in most cases this is a very good approximation. In practice, the value of g will depend both on the distance from the centre of the Earth and the composition (density) of the material in the Earth’s crust below where g is being measured. Precise measurements of g have bee used to determine the composition of the Earth’s crust and to search for mineral and oil deposits.","type":"content","url":"/gravity#newtons-universal-theory-of-gravity","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl3":"Weight and apparent weight","lvl2":"Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/gravity#weight-and-apparent-weight","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl3":"Weight and apparent weight","lvl2":"Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity"},"content":"You have probably seen images of astronauts floating around the International Space Station (ISS) or other orbiting vessels, and heard of the term “weightlessness”  to describe their motion. The ISS is in orbit at an altitude of approximately 400 {\\rm km}, where the force of Earth’s gravity is far from negligible (in \n\nExample 9.3 we showed that one needs to go to an altitude of 2640 {\\rm km} for the force to be reduced by half of that at the surface of the Earth). The contradiction between being weightless and the fact that weight is not zero is resolved by understanding that the popular term “weightless” is imprecise from a physics perspective.\n\nThe correct term to use from a physics perspective is to say that the apparent weight of the astronauts is zero when they are floating around. Weight is the magnitude of the force of gravity exerted by the Earth. Apparent weight is, for example, the force that one measures when standing on a spring scale, which is equal to the normal force exerted by the spring scale on the person. Apparent weight could also be determined by the tension in a string from which a person is suspended. The apparent weight is the sum of the forces exerted on a person minus the force of gravity. If gravity is the only force exerted on a person (or object), that person’s apparent weight is zero, which is what is popularly called being weightless.\n\nOne way to feel weightless is when you are in free-fall (e.g. the first few seconds of a parachute jump from an airplane). One can think of being in orbit as continuously falling towards the centre of the Earth, but with an initial velocity in a direction such that you never actually collide with the Earth. The feeling of weightlessness will occur any time that the only force exerted on you is the force of gravity. If you are in a spacecraft in any orbit and the only force on the spacecraft is from gravity (i.e. no rockets or wings are exerting any forces), then everything in the spacecraft will have the same acceleration, since gravity is the only force acting on anything in the spacecraft, and it will appear that everything is just floating. To an outside observer, it would be clear that the spacecraft and its contents are all accelerating.","type":"content","url":"/gravity#weight-and-apparent-weight","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl4":"Effects of Earth’s rotation","lvl3":"Weight and apparent weight","lvl2":"Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/gravity#effects-of-earths-rotation","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl4":"Effects of Earth’s rotation","lvl3":"Weight and apparent weight","lvl2":"Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity"},"content":"Earth’s rotation affects the apparent weight of objects near the Earth’s surface. Consider a person standing on a spring scale at the North pole (top free-body diagram in \n\nFigure 6). The only two forces exerted on the person are their weight, \\vec F_g, and the normal force, \\vec N, exerted by the spring scale. Since the person is not accelerating, the normal force and the weight have the same magnitude and opposite directions. The scale will thus read the actual weight of the person.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:The apparent weight, given by the normal force, is different at the Earth’s equator because a person’s acceleration is non-zero as they rotate with the Earth.\n\nConsider, instead, a person standing on a spring scale at the equator (\n\nFigure 6). That person is accelerating because they are undergoing uniform circular motion as they rotate along with the Earth. Again, the only forces acting on the person are their weight and the normal force exerted by the scale. The sum of the forces must now be equal to the person’s mass, m, times the radial acceleration, a_r, that is necessary for them to follow the surface of the Earth as the Earth rotates about its axis. Newton’s Second Law allows us to find the magnitude of the normal force acting on the person:\\sum F &= F_g-N=ma_r=m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n\\therefore N &= F_g - m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n&=G\\frac{Mm}{R^2} -  m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n&=m\\left(G\\frac{M}{R^2} - \\frac{v^2}{R}  \\right)\\\\\n&=m\\left(g - \\frac{v^2}{R}  \\right)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the Earth, R is the radius of the Earth, and v is the speed at the surface of the Earth due to the Earth’s rotation.  In the last line, we used the result from \n\nExample 9.3 where we determined the value of g in terms of the mass and radius of the Earth.\n\nWe see that the normal force is reduced compared to what it would be if the Earth were not rotating (v=0) or if one is standing at one of the poles. Your apparent weight, which you can measure by standing on a spring scale, is thus smaller at the equator than it is at the poles. The quantity in parenthesis can be thought of as a modified or “effective” value of g at the equator.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat is the effective value of g at the equator?\n\n9.80 {\\rm m/s^2}\n\n9.78 {\\rm m/s^2}\n\n9.70 {\\rm m/s^2}\n\n9.51 {\\rm m/s^2}\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nIf you are circling the Earth a distance R from the centre of the Earth at a constant speed v, it is possible for your apparent weight to be zero. Imagine standing on a scale in an aircraft that is circling the Earth and measuring your apparent weight with the spring scale. As the speed of the aircraft increases, your apparent weight, N, decreases according to the formula that we just found:N=m\\left(G\\frac{M}{R^2} - \\frac{v^2}{R}  \\right)\n\nAt a certain speed, v, your apparent weight is zero and you feel weightless:G\\frac{M}{R^2} &= \\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n\\therefore v&= \\sqrt{G\\frac{M}{R} }\n\nThis speed corresponds to a centripetal acceleration that is exactly equal to that due to gravity. This makes sense, since gravity is the only force that is acting on you (the normal force is now zero), which is exactly what we call being in orbit.\n\nEarth’s rotation has some interesting consequences for stationary objects. At any position on Earth that is not at the equator or the poles, the sum of the forces on any stationary object (meaning stationary relative to the Earth’s surface) cannot be zero. This is because the object must rotate along with the Earth, so the net force on the object must point toward the centre of the circle about which that location on Earth is rotating.\n\nTake, for example, a plumb line, which consists of a mass hanging from a string. The two forces acting on the mass are gravity and tension. The force of gravity must point towards the centre of the Earth. We would expect that the force of tension, and therefore the string, would point directly away from the centre of the Earth. However, we find that if the plumb line is located at some angle θ from the equator (but not at the equator or poles), as in \n\nFigure 7, then the string will point slightly away from the centre of the Earth.  In order for the mass to remain stationary relative to the ground, it must rotate along with the Earth (radius R) around a circle of radius R\\cos\\theta.   Thus, the tension from the string cannot point away from the centre of the Earth, because the net force must point towards the centre of the circle of radius R\\cos\\theta.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:Away from the equator and poles, a plumb line (right) does not point towards the centre of the Earth, because the net force on the mass must provide the acceleration towards the centre of the circle (of radius R\\cos\\theta) about which the plumb line rotates due to the Earth’s rotation. Note that the deflection of the plumb line is highly exaggerated.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nYou cut the string of the plumb line. Where does the mass land relative to its initial latitude (the angle θ in \n\nFigure 7)?\n\nAt the same latitude.\n\nCloser to the nearest pole.\n\nCloser to the equator.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/gravity#effects-of-earths-rotation","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl3":"The gravitational field","lvl2":"Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/gravity#the-gravitational-field","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl3":"The gravitational field","lvl2":"Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity"},"content":"The gravitational force exerted on a mass m by a mass M can be written as:\\vec F(\\vec r) = -G\\frac{Mm}{r^2}\\hat r\n\nif we define a coordinate system with the origin located at the centre of mass M so that \\vec r is the position of m relative to M.

It is also worth noting that the two are only equal if the gravitational mass (on the left of the equation in the second line) is the same as the inertial mass (on the right of the equation). The gravitational mass is the mass that appears in the gravitational force defined by Newton, whereas the inertial mass is the mass that appears with the acceleration in Newton’s Second Law.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nTwo small objects with different masses, m_1 and m_2, are located a distance r from a nearby star.

We can calculate the net gravitational force on m by summing the gravitational force vectors from M_1 and M_2 separately. If the gravitational fields from M_1 and M_2 are given by \\vec g_1(\\vec r) and \\vec g_2(\\vec r), respectively, then the total gravitational force on m is given by:\\vec F &= m\\vec g_1(\\vec r) + m\\vec g_2(\\vec r)=m(\\vec g_1(\\vec r)+\\vec g_2(\\vec r))\\\\\n&=m \\vec g(\\vec r)\n\nwhere we have introduced the total gravitational field:\\vec g(\\vec r) = \\vec g_1(\\vec r)+\\vec g_2(\\vec r)\n\nIn other words, if there are multiple bodies that result in a non-negligible force of gravity, we can calculate their gravitational fields independently and sum them together to define a net gravitational field, \\vec g(\\vec r), that models the net force of gravity from all of the bodies. The net gravitational force on a new body of mass m' is then simply given by m'\\vec g(\\vec r), and we do not need to add any more vectors together. For example, when calculating the motion of satellites that can be influenced by the force of gravity from both the Earth and the Moon, we simply need to calculate the net gravitational field from the Earth and Moon, and the motion of any satellite can then be modelled using that net gravitational field.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nThere are two planets with equal mass located a distance d apart.

Using the terminology of a field, we would say that the strength of the gravitational field from an object decreases as the inverse of the square of the distance to that object. This is an example of a what we generally call an “inverse-square law”. The electric force between two charges is also given by an inverse-square law, and we now understand that these forces behave as if they were “transmitted” by waves or particles.\n\nIf a force is given by an inverse-square law, then Gauss’s law gives a way to determine the strength of the field that is associated with that force. In the case of gravity, Gauss’s law states that:\\oint \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A = 4\\pi G M^{enc}\n\nwhere the integral on the left is an integral over a “closed surface” that completely surrounds the mass for which we want to determine the gravitational field. To evaluate the integral, imagine taking a closed surface, S, that surrounds the mass. The vector d\\vec A is defined as the vector that goes with a small element of that surface and points outwards from the closed surface. The magnitude of the vector is equal to the area of that small surface (dA), as illustrated in \n\nFigure 9. You can then take the scalar product of d\\vec A with the gravitational field, \\vec g(\\vec r), at that point on the surface. If you sum all of those scalar products, you get the value of the integral on the left. Gauss’s law states that the value of that integral is equal 4 \\pi G times the total mass that is enclosed by the surface.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nIf you want to know if a surface is closed, ask yourself if you could put water inside the surface and not be worried about it spilling out. For example, if you put water in a sphere or a cube , the water would not spill out even if you shook it around, so they are closed surfaces. A flat square is an open surface because there is no “inside” to even put the water in.  A bowl is an open surface because, though you can put water in it, the water could spill out.\n\nWe will go into more detail about Gauss’s law when we cover electromagnetism, but it is worth seeing how to use it in a simple scenario. \n\nFigure 9 shows a spherical body of mass M and radius R for which we would like to determine the value of the gravitational field at a distance r from the centre of the body.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:Example of a spherical Gaussian surface, S, of radius r centred about a body of mass M and radius R. An element of the surface, d\\vec A is also shown along with the gravitational field, \\vec g(\\vec r), at that point.\n\nTo do so, we draw a “Gaussian surface”, S, that is a sphere with a radius r, and centred about the body. At any point on the surface, the area element vector d\\vec A points away from the centre of the spherical surface. The gravitational field vector, \\vec g(\\vec r) will always point towards the centre of the spherical surface, as illustrated. Furthermore, by symmetry, the magnitude of \\vec g(\\vec r) is constant along the whole Gaussian surface. Thus, the scalar product \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A=-g(r)dA everywhere along the surface (it is negative because the two vectors are anti-parallel). The integral is thus given by:\\oint \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A = -g(r)\\oint dA\n\nwhere we factored g(r) out of the integral, since the magnitude of \\vec g(\\vec r) is constant for all of the area elements dA on the sphere. Remember that an integral is a sum. The integral \\oint dA thus means “sum all of the area elements dA over the entire surface S”. Thus, the integral is the total area of the spherical surface S:\\oint \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A = -g(r)\\oint dA =-g(r)(4\\pi r^2)\n\nInserting this into Gauss’s law, we find:\\oint \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A &= 4\\pi G M^{enc}\\\\\n-g(r)(4\\pi r^2) &= 4\\pi G M^{enc}\\\\\n\\therefore g(r) &= - \\frac{GM}{r^2}\n\nwhere M^{enc}=M is the total mass enclosed by the Gaussian surface (in this case, the entire mass M is enclosed). This is of course the result that we expected and obtained earlier from Newton’s formulation. Note that Gauss’s law is only easy to use if the system is highly symmetric (e.g. spherically symmetric), and that it does not give the direction of the field vector, which must be obtained from symmetry arguments.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nHere’s an analogy to describe Gauss’s law for gravity: A famous celebrity is doing an event, and they attract a certain number of fans who want to get as close to the celebrity as possible. You put up a barricade around the celebrity. The gravitational field is represented by how crowded it is somewhere along the barricade. If a second celebrity is at the event, they will attract their own fans, so there will be more people around the barricade. The number of celebrities is kind of like the enclosed mass M^{enc}.\n\nA photographer is coming to the event, and you told him to stand at some location that is a distance r from the celebrities. The photographer wants to know how crowded it will be when he is standing behind the barricade at that location. Gauss’s law gives us a way to figure this out. If you know which celebrities are at the event (M^{enc}), you can determine how many people will be there (this is like finding 4\\pi GM^{enc}). Then, if you can build a barricade such that the fans are evenly distributed around it, and you know how long that barricade is (\\oint dA), you can easily calculate how crowded it will be at some point along the barricade (you can just divide the number of people by the length of the barricade).\n\nThe barricade represents our Gaussian surface and, like a Gaussian surface, it can be whatever shape we want as long as it encloses the celebrities and passes through the point we are interested in. If we want to make sure the people are spread out evenly, the shape of the barricade is going to depend on the specific case. Let’s take the example of our single spherical body. This is analagous to having one celebrity at the event.\n\nFigure 10 shows two possible barricades we could build. Although we can technically build the barricade on the left, it doesn’t help us because the areas closer to the celebrity will be more crowded. Instead, we want to build the barricade on the right, which is a circle of radius r, because the fans are evenly spread out. This is why we use a spherical Gaussian surface when we’re considering the field due to a spherical body - at any point a distance r from the body, the field will be the same. (Note: Remember that, unlike the barricade, the Gaussian surface isn’t a physical thing, so it won’t affect the gravitational field. It is just a mathematical tool that allows us to take advantage of what the field already looks like.)\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A celebrity (black dot) attracts fans (grey dots). A photographer (dot labelled “P”) stands behind the barricade a distance r away. This shows two possible barricades we could build around the celebrity. The density of the fans is not uniform for the barricade on the left, so we would not choose that shape to evaluate the Gaussian integral.\n\nWe can also use Gauss’s law to determine the gravitational field inside of the body of mass M and radius R. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 11, which shows a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r that is inside of the body of mass M.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:Example of a spherical Gaussian surface, S, of radius r centred inside a body of mass M and radius R.\n\nThe gravitational field inside of the body of mass M is also symmetric\nand  constant in magnitude across the whole surface, %?\nso that the integral is the same as before:\\oint \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A=-g(r)(4\\pi r^2)\n\nHowever, in order to use Gauss’s law, we need to determine the mass of the body that is enclosed within the spherical surface, which will be less than M. If we assume that the mass density, ρ, of the object is constant (the body is made of a uniform material), then the density is simply the mass of the object over its volume:\\rho = \\frac{M}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3}\n\nThe amount of mass enclosed by the spherical surface of radius r is the density multiplied by the volume of a sphere of radius r:M^{enc} = \\rho \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = M\\frac{r^3}{R^3}\n\nApplying Gauss’s law, we can now find the magnitude of the gravitational field inside of the spherical body at a distance r from the centre:\\oint \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A &= 4\\pi G M^{enc}\\\\\n-g(r)(4\\pi r^2) &= 4\\pi G M\\frac{r^3}{R^3}\\\\\n\\therefore g(r) &= - \\frac{G M}{R^3}r\n\nAnd we find that, inside a uniform spherical body of mass M, the gravitational field increases linearly with radius as one moves out from the centre. At the centre of the body, the gravitational field is zero.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat can you say about the magnitude of the gravitational field inside a spherical shell of mass M?\n\nIt increases as you move out from the centre of the spherical shell.\n\nIt decreases as you move out from the centre of the spherical shell.\n\nIt is equal to zero.\n\nIt is nonzero and constant in magnitude.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/gravity#sec-gravity-gauss","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Gravitational potential energy"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gravity#sec-gravity-potentialenergy","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Gravitational potential energy"},"content":"Consider a large spherical body of mass M with a coordinate system whose origin coincides with the centre of the spherical body (for example, the large body could be the Earth).

This corresponds to choosing the potential energy to be zero only when r goes to infinity. That is, the potential energy of mass m is zero only when it is infinitely far away from mass M. The choice of constant C corresponds to the (arbitrary) value of the potential energy when mass m is infinitely far from mass M. When mass m is not infinitely far away, it has negative potential energy (if C=0). This is not a problem! Remember, the only thing that is meaningful is a difference in potential energy, so the specific value of the potential energy has no meaning. The kinetic energy of an object, on the other hand, has to be positive.\n\nRecall that if there are no other forces acting on an object, that object will move in such a way to reduce its potential energy. If the object of mass m is located at some distance r from the object of mass M, the force of gravity will attract m so that r decreases. As r decreases in magnitude, the potential energy becomes more negative (larger in magnitude, but further away from zero), and the potential energy of m will indeed decrease as it accelerates due to the force of gravity.","type":"content","url":"/gravity#sec-gravity-potentialenergy","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl3":"Mechanical energy with gravity","lvl2":"Gravitational potential energy"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/gravity#mechanical-energy-with-gravity","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl3":"Mechanical energy with gravity","lvl2":"Gravitational potential energy"},"content":"Unless noted otherwise, we will continue our discussion of gravitational potential energy with the particular choice of constant C=0:\\boxed{U(r) = -G\\frac{Mm}{r}}\n\nFurthermore, we will assume that M is a large body, such as the Earth, which we can consider as fixed, and focus our discussion on describing the motion of mass m (e.g. a satellite). If M is much bigger than m, they will both experience a force of gravity from each other of the same magnitude (Newton’s Third Law), but because M is so much larger, its acceleration will be much smaller (Newton’s Second Law). Thus, it is a good approximation to assume that M is stationary and that only m moves when M>>m.\n\nWe can define the total mechanical energy of mass m when it has a speed v (relative to M) and is located at a distance r from the centre of mass M:E = U + K = -G\\frac{Mm}{r}+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\nwhere the kinetic energy term is always positive. If gravity is the only force exerted on mass m, then the mechanical energy, E, as defined above, will be a constant. The mechanical energy of an object can give us insight into the possible motion of the object.\n\nImagine launching a rocket straight upwards from the surface of the Earth; once all of the fuel has burnt up, the rocket’s mechanical energy becomes constant as the rocket engine stops doing work on the rocket. As soon as the engine stops providing thrust, the rocket will start to slow down as the force of gravity attracts the rocket back to Earth. If the rocket is going fast enough, it will be able to completely escape the Earth’s gravitational pull and travel to infinity (we assume that there are no other planets or the Sun, just the Earth exists!). If, on the other hand, the rocket’s speed is too low, it will eventually stop and fall back to Earth. This is the same thing that happens to you when you try to jump vertically. If you could jump hard enough, you would be able to escape the Earth’s gravitational pull!\n\nIn terms of mechanical energy, we can ask ourselves if the mechanical energy of the rocket is large enough to escape the Earth’s gravitational pull. Specifically, we can ask ourselves what the value of the rocket’s kinetic energy would be when it reaches infinity. The kinetic energy of the rocket is given by:K = E - U\n\nIf the rocket is infinitely far from the Earth, then its potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is equal to E.\n\nIf the mechanical energy, E, is negative, it is not possible for the rocket to ever make it to infinity because its kinetic energy would have to be negative. In other words, if the mechanical energy is negative, then the object of mass m can never escape the gravitational pull of object M. We say that m is “gravitationally bound” to M.\n\nIf the mechanical energy, E, is exactly zero, then the object’s kinetic energy will become zero just as it reaches infinity. In other words, it will just barely be able to escape the gravitational pull from mass M. The condition for this to happen is:E &= 0\\\\\nK & = -U\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 &= G\\frac{Mm}{r}\\\\\n\\therefore v_{esc} &= \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\n\nwhich we can interpret as a condition for the speed of the rocket. If at some distance r from M, the rocket has the speed given by the condition above, then it will have enough kinetic energy to escape the gravitational pull of M. We call this speed the “escape velocity”.\n\nFinally, if the mechanical energy is greater than zero, then the rocket will have enough energy to escape the gravitational pull of M and have a non-zero speed when it reaches infinity.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat is the escape velocity from the surface of the Earth?\n\n4.29\\times 10^{6} {\\rm km/s}\n\n1.25\\times 10^{5} {\\rm km/s}\n\n11.2 {\\rm km/s}\n\n9.81 {\\rm km/s}\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 9.4\n\nShow that an object of mass m in a circular orbit of radius r around a body of mass M has half of the kinetic energy required to escape the gravitational pull of M.\n\nSolution\n\nThe only force acting on the object is gravity, so it has a mechanical energy given by:E&=U+K\\\\\nE&=-G\\frac{Mm}{r}+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\nIn order for the object to just escape the gravitational pull of M, it’s mechanical energy must be equal to zero:E&=0\\\\\n\\therefore K_{esc}&=-U\n\nSince the object is in a circular orbit, we can use Newton’s Second Law to find an expression for v^2:F_{net}&=\\frac{mv^2}{r}\\\\\n\\frac{GMm}{r^2}&=\\frac{mv^2}{r}\\\\\n\\frac{GM}{r}&=v^2\n\nwhere in the second line we used the fact that F_{net} is equal to the force of gravity exerted by M on the object.

For example, precision measurements of  Uranus’s orbit showed that it appeared to be inconsistent with Newton’s theory, unless the gravitational influence of another planet was included in the model. This led to the discovery of the planet Neptune.\n\nHowever, some issues with Newton’s theory were uncovered. The orbit of Mercury was shown to be different than what Newton’s theory could describe, but searches for another planet (Vulcan) were unsuccessful. In addition, Albert Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity, published in 1905, was found to be incompatible with Newton’s theory of gravity. One of the consequences of Special Relativity is that nothing can propagate faster than the speed of light. Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity implies that the gravitational force is transmitted instantaneously. In Newton’s theory, if the Sun suddenly disappeared, Earth would immediately “fall out” of its orbit, and we would immediately know that the Sun has disappeared. This would violate Special Relativity because there cannot be a mechanism that would allow us to know that the Sun has disappeared faster than it would take light to propagate from the Sun. In other words, for the 8 {\\rm min} that are required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, we cannot know that the Sun has disappeared: only when we literally see the Sun disappear would the Earth be “allowed” to fall out of its orbit.\n\nEinstein’s Theory of General Relativity is a theory developed by Einstein in order to describe gravity in a way that is consistent with Special Relativity and the propagation of light. Einstein was famous for his “thought experiments,” which allow us to think about some of the implications of a theory, even if the experiments would be very difficult to carry out in practice. One such thought experiment is to consider what someone would observe in an accelerating frame of reference.\n\nConsider an observer in an elevator, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 14. If the elevator is stationary at the surface of the Earth (left panel), and the observer is standing on a scale, they could measure their weight, mg, on the scale. The two forces on the observer are their weight and the normal force, which would be equal in magnitude since the observer is not accelerating. The normal force, read out by the scale, would thus correspond to their weight. To be more precise, the normal force would be equal to m_Gg, where m_G is the gravitational mass of the observer (that mass which is related to the force of gravity experienced by a mass).\n\nIf the elevator was instead placed in empty space, and the elevator was accelerating upwards with an acceleration of g (right panel), the observer would still be able to measure their weight by stepping on the scale. The only force on the observer is the normal force from the scale, which must be equal to its mass times their acceleration N=m_Ia=m_Ig, since the observer is accelerating with the elevator. In this case, it is the inertial mass of the observer, m_I, that comes into play, so the normal force read on the scale is m_Ig.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Left: A person standing on a scale in an elevator at rest at the surface of the Earth. Right: A person in an elevator that is accelerating in empty space with the same acceleration as that due to gravity at the Earth’s surface. The curvature of the light beam is exaggerated.\n\nEinstein postulated that it would be impossible for the observer to distinguish whether they are at rest on the surface of the Earth, or in empty space accelerating with an acceleration of g. In other words, he postulated that the inertial and gravitational masses are exactly equivalent. This is what is called the “Equivalence Principle”.\n\nThis simple statement has dramatic implications. Special Relativity requires that light will travel in a straight line in empty space. If a beam of light enters and then exits the elevator, the observer on Earth and the one accelerating in empty space must observe the same thing, since they cannot distinguish between being on Earth or accelerating in space. The observer in space, who is accelerating, will observe that the beam of light bends as it crosses the elevator (the beam travels in a straight line as observed in an inertial reference frame, so the person in the accelerating elevator would see it follow a parabolic path). The observer on Earth must thus observe the same thing, namely that light will follow a curved path in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut...light must travel in a straight line in empty space. That means that if the path of a beam of light is curved near Earth, it must be because space itself is curved in the presence of a gravitational field! In other words, Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity describes how the presence of mass (or energy) results in a curvature of space (and time).\n\nImagine a ladybug on the side of a basketball. If the ladybug starts moving in what it believes to be a straight line, it will actually move in a curved path along the surface of the ball, as in \n\nFigure 15. This is like the curved path of light that we observe. If we didn’t know the ball was there, we would just think that the bug was moving along a curved path. In the same way, if an observer is not aware of the curvature of spacetime, it appears that light follows a curved path.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:Left: A ladybug perceives itself to be moving in a straight line. Center: The basketball is curved, so the ladybugs follow curved paths. Right: What an observer would see if they didn’t know the basketball was there.\n\nNow imagine there’s a second ladybug. Both bugs start at the middle of the ball and start moving towards the top of the ball in what they think is a straight line (as shown in the center panel of \n\nFigure 15). When the bugs start moving, they are parallel to each other, so if the ball was not curved, the ladybugs would never meet. However, because it is curved, the ladybugs will eventually cross paths. If you were not aware that the ball was there, you would have to conclude that there was some force attracting the bugs to each other, just like if you were unaware that spacetime was curved, you would conclude that massive bodies moving towards each other are attracted by a gravitational force.\n\nObjects that are moving in a gravitational field are actually following Newton’s First Law (they are moving at constant velocity in a straight line and no force is exerted on them). It is strange and unexpected, but high precision measurements confirm that this correctly describes everything that we have measured!\n\nEinstein’s theory was able to describe the orbit of Mercury, and the prediction that gravity leads to light following a curved path was confirmed by Eddington within five years of Einstein’s theory being published. Another implication of the theory is that time goes by slower in the presence of a gravitational field. Clocks on Earth run slower than clocks in orbit (where the gravitational field is weaker). This effect is taken into account when using GPS to determine your position on Earth, since this is based on comparing the time that it takes signals to arrive to your position on Earth from different satellites. This is also somewhat reasonably well described in the movie “Interstallar”, where time is seen to pass much slower for a set of astronauts in the vicinity of a black hole, where the gravitational field is strong.","type":"content","url":"/gravity#einsteins-theory-of-general-relativity","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gravity#summary","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"Kepler was the first to synthesize a large amount of data to quantitatively describe gravity with his three laws:\n\nThe path of a planet around the Sun is described by an ellipse with the Sun at once of its foci.\n\nPlanets move in such a way that the area swept by a line connecting the planet and the Sun in a given period of time is constant, independent of the location of the planet.\n\nThe ratio between the orbital periods, T, squared of two planets is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes, s, of their orbits cubed:\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{s_1}{s_2}\\right)^3\n\nNewton described the attractive force of gravity exerted between two bodies of mass M_1 and M_2 (which must be point masses) as:\\vec F_{12}=-G\\frac{M_1M_2}{r^2}\\hat r_{21}\n\nwhere \\vec F_{12} is the force on body 1 from body 2, r is the distance between the two bodies, and \\vec r_{21} is the vector from body 2 to body 1.

Furthermore, if no non-conservative forces do work on the body of mass m, the mechanical energy, E, is constant.\n\nIf the mechanical energy of m is negative, it is gravitationally bound to M. Depending on the mechanical energy of m and its velocity at the point of closest approach to M, the orbit of m will be described by one of four conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola).\n\nEinstein’s Theory of General Relativity describes gravitation as the bending of space and time caused by the presence of mass and energy. In Einstein’s theory, objects follow straight (inertial) paths and do not feel a force of gravity. The curvature of space is what results in their apparent motion not being a straight line. Einstein’s theory is based on the Equivalence Principle (inertial and gravitational mass are exactly equal) and the properties of how light propagates according to the Theory of Special Relativity.\n\\end{chapterSummary}\n\nImportant Equations\n\nKepler’s Third Law:\\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{s_1}{s_2}\\right)^3\n\nGravitational force and\\ gravitational field:\\vec F_{12}&=-G\\frac{M_1M_2}{r^2}\\hat r_{21}\\\\\n\\vec g(\\vec r)&=-G\\frac{M}{r^2}\\hat r\\\\\nF_g &= m \\vec g(\\vec r)\n\nGauss’s Law:\\oint \\vec g(\\vec r) \\cdot d\\vec A = 4\\pi G M^{enc}\n\nGravitational potential energy\\ and mechanical energy:U(r) = -G\\frac{Mm}{r} + C\\\\\nE = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - G\\frac{Mm}{r}","type":"content","url":"/gravity#summary","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Thinking about the material"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gravity#thinking-about-the-material","position":32},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 9 - Gravity","lvl2":"Thinking about the material"},"content":"Reflect and research\n\nWhen you look at the night sky, how can you tell the difference between a planet and a star?\n\nWhat was the relationship between Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler?\n\nHow did Tycho Brahe collect all the data that Kepler used?\n\nHow much time elapsed between Kepler publishing his laws and Newton publishing his Universal Theory of Gravity?\n\nWhat was Kepler’s original intention when he synthesized Tycho Brahe’s observations?

Since the satellite is in a circular orbit, that force of gravity must point towards the centre of the Earth in such a way that the satellite has the correct radial acceleration, a_R, to stay in uniform circular motion:a_r=\\frac{v^2}{R}\n\nwhere v is the speed of the satellite, and R is the distance between the satellite and the centre of the Earth (i.e. the centre of the circular orbit). The magnitude of the force of gravity on the satellite of mass m is given by:F = G\\frac{Mm}{R^2}\n\nwhere M is the mass of the Earth.

That work will be done by a non-conservative force (a rocket engine). The work done by the non-conservative force, W, is equal to the satellite’s change in mechanical energy:W = \\Delta E = E_B -E_A\n\nThe initial mechanical energy of the satellite, E_A, is given by its gravitational potential energy (it has no kinetic energy at the surface of the Earth when at the North Pole - on the equator, it would have kinetic energy due to the Earth’s rotation):E_A = K + U = 0 - G\\frac{Mm}{R_\\oplus}\n\nwhere M=5.97\\times 10^{24} {\\rm kg} is the mass of the Earth, and R_\\oplus=6.731\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m} is the radius of the Earth.\n\nIn orbit, the energy of the rocket, E_B, is given by:E_B = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - G\\frac{Mm}{R}\n\nwhere R=42.2\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m} is the radius of the geosynchronous orbit (\n\nProblem ??) and v is the speed of the satellite in orbit. The speed is given by:v = \\frac{2\\pi R}{T}\n\nwhere T=24 {\\rm h} is the orbital period. The net work that must be done to place the satellite in orbit is thus given by:W &= E_B - E_A = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - G\\frac{Mm}{R} - \\left(- G\\frac{Mm}{R_\\oplus}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}m\\frac{4\\pi^2 R^2}{T^2}+GMm\\left(\\frac{1}{R_\\oplus}-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}(1000 {\\rm kg})\\frac{4\\pi^2 (42.2\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m})^2}{(86400 {\\rm s})^2}\\\\\n&+(6.67\\times 10^{-11} {\\rm Nm^2/kg^2})(5.97\\times 10^{24} {\\rm kg})(1000 {\\rm kg})\\left(\\frac{1}{(6.731\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m})}-\\frac{1}{(42.2\\times 10^{6} {\\rm m})}\\right)\\\\\n&=5.78\\times 10^{10} {\\rm J}\n\nThis corresponds to the energy that must be imparted to a 1000 {\\rm kg} satellite for it to end up in a geosynchronous orbit. This corresponds to 5.78\\times 10^{7} {\\rm J/kg} as the energy required per kilogram of payload placed in geosynchronous orbit. Although we calculated work as if it were work done by a force, we can think of this work coming from stored chemical potential energy in the fuel of the rocket carrying the satellite.\n\nDiscussion: The energy that we found above is the minimum energy that one must provide to the satellite. In practice, in order to place a satellite in orbit, one will also need to provide enough energy to accelerate the rocket that carries the satellite up into orbit, which is typically much heavier than the satellite. If the satellite were instead launched from the equator of the Earth, the satellite would already have some initial kinetic energy due to the rotation of the Earth, and one would need to provide less energy to place it in orbit. This is the reason that most rockets are launched from near the equator (think French Guyana, Florida, Kazakhstan) in a direction that is roughly parallel with the Earth’s rotation.\n\nSolution 9.3\n\nWe cannot use Gauss’s law to determine the magnitude of the field because the gravitational field lacks symmetry (i.e. the field will be different at the ends of the rod than along the length of the rod). The gravitational field due to a body of mass M is given by:\\vec g(\\vec r)=-\\frac{GM}{r^2}\\hat{r}\n\nOur strategy will be to break the rod into very small segments of length dx. Each segment, of mass dM, will make a small contribution, d\\vec g, to the gravitational field, as shown in \n\nFigure 17. We will then take the sum of all these contributions to find the net field.\n\n\n\nFigure 17:A thin rod of mass M and length L produces a gravitational field at a point P located above the midsection of the rod. Each segment of the rod dx will contribute to the gravitational field.\n\nThe gravitational field due to each segment is given by:d\\vec g=-\\frac{GdM}{r^2}\\hat{r}\n\nThe element of the field, d\\vec g, will point in a different direction for each segment dx. You can conclude from \n\nFigure 17 that, due to symmetry, the x components of the field from each segment will cancel out (for the segment dx shown in the diagram, there will be an identical segment on the other side of the rod). The net field will point in the -\\hat{y} direction, so we are only interested in the vertical component of d\\vec g. Using our diagram, this means that we want to find the magnitude of dg\\cos\\theta:dg\\cos\\theta=\\frac{G dM}{r^2}\\cos\\theta\n\nThe magnitude of the gravitational field at point P is thus given by:g = \\int dg\\cos\\theta =\\int \\frac{G dM}{r^2}\\cos\\theta\n\nThe integral is written over dM, where both r, and θ are different for each different mass element, dM. We need to express any variable that changes for different mass elements in terms of a single variable of integration. We will choose θ as the variable of integration, and thus need to express r and dM in terms of θ, d\\theta, and other constants.\n\nThe distance, r, between P and a mass element dM located at angle θ is easily found to be:r &= \\frac{h}{\\cos\\theta}\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{1}{r^2} &= \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{h^2}\n\ndM can easily be expressed in term of dx (the length of the mass element in the x direction) and λ, the mass per unit length of the rod:dM = \\lambda dx = \\frac{M}{L} dx\n\nWe now need to express dx in terms of d\\theta. This can be found as follows, by first expressing x in terms of θ, and then taking the derivative of x with respect to θx &= h\\tan\\theta\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{dx}{d\\theta}&=\\frac{h}{\\cos^2\\theta}\\\\\n\\therefore dx  &= \\frac{h}{\\cos^2\\theta} d\\theta\n\nNow that we have found the small change in x that results from a small change in θ, we can write the mass element, dM, in terms of the d\\theta:dM = \\frac{M}{L} dx = \\frac{M}{L}  \\frac{h}{\\cos^2\\theta} d\\theta\n\nWe can now write the integral in terms of θ:g = \\int \\frac{GdM}{r^2}\\cos\\theta&=G\\int \\frac{1}{r^2}\\cos\\theta dM\\\\\n&=G\\int \\left( \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{h^2} \\right)\\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{M}{L}  \\frac{h}{\\cos^2\\theta}  \\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{GM}{Lh}\\int\\cos\\theta d\\theta\n\nNow that we have the integral over θ, we need to set the limits to correspond to the values of θ at each end of the rod. The angle will have the same magnitude for each end of the rod, \\theta _0, given by:\\sin\\theta_0 =\\frac{L}{2\\sqrt{h^2 + \\frac{L^2}{4}}}\n\nThe magnitude of the field is thus given by:g &=\\frac{GM}{Lh}\\int_{-\\theta_0}^{\\theta_0}\\cos\\theta d\\theta\\\\\n&= \\frac{GM}{Lh} {\\rm \\left[n\\theta\\right]}_{-\\theta_0}^{\\theta_0}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2GM}{Lh} \\sin\\theta_0\\\\\n&= \\frac{2GM}{Lh} \\frac{L}{2\\sqrt{h^2 + \\frac{L^2}{4}}}\n\nThe gravitational field at point P is thus given by:\\vec g =  -\\frac{2GM}{Lh} \\frac{L}{2\\sqrt{h^2 + \\frac{L^2}{4}}}\\hat y\n\nIn fact, they apply for any two bodies orbiting each other if the force between them is an “inverse-square” law, such as the gravitational and electric forces.\n\nThe weight that is displayed on the scale is equal in magnitude to the normal force exerted by the scale on the person.

If s is the distance along the circumference of the circle, measured counter-clockwise from where the circle intersects the x axis, then it is related to the angular displacement:\\begin{align*}\ns = R\\theta\n\\end{align*}\n\nif θ is expressed in radians.

By using vectors, we can define the angular quantities for rotation about an axis that can point in any direction. Given an axis of rotation, the path of any particle rotating about that axis can be described by a circle that lies in the plane perpendicular to that axis of rotation, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Defining the vector \\vec r and the angular velocity, \\vec \\omega for a particle with velocity \\vec v rotating about an axis in a general direction.\n\nWe define the vector, \\vec r, for a particle to be the vector that goes from the axis of rotation to the particle and is in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, as in \n\nFigure 3. Given the velocity vector of the particle, \\vec v, we define its angular velocity vector, \\vec\\omega, about the axis of rotation, as:\\boxed{\\vec \\omega = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\vec r \\times \\vec v}\n\nThe angular velocity vector is perpendicular to both the velocity vector and the vector \\vec r, since it is defined as their cross-product. Thus, the angular velocity vector is co-linear with the axis of rotation. By using the angular velocity vector, we can specify the direction of the axis of rotation as well as the direction in which the particle is rotating about that axis. The direction of rotation is given by the right hand rule for axial vectors: when you point your thumb in the same direction as the angular velocity vector, the direction of rotation is the direction that your fingers point when you curl them, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Using the right hand rule for axial vectors. In this case, the direction of rotation is counter clockwise when looking at the page (the direction that the fingers curl), so the rotation vector points out of the page (the direction of the thumb).\n\nThis definition of the angular velocity is consistent with the description from the previous section for motion about a circle of radius R that lies in the xy plane, as in \n\nFigure 1. In that case, the magnitude of the angular velocity is given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\omega &=\\frac{1}{r^2} || \\vec r \\times \\vec v||= \\frac{1}{r^2}r v\\sin\\phi= \\frac{v}{R}\\\\\n\\therefore v &= R\\omega\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere ϕ is the angle between the vectors \\vec r and \\vec v (90{\\degree} for motion around a circle).

The angular velocity vector of the door is:\n\nUpwards\n\nDownwards\n\nForwards\n\nBackwards\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nOne can always define an angular velocity vector relative to a point of rotation, even if the particle is not moving along a circle. If we define the vector \\vec r to be the vector from the point of rotation to the particle, then the angular velocity vector describes the motion of the particle as if it were instantaneously moving in a circle centred at the point of rotation, in a plane given by the vectors \\vec r and \\vec v.\n\nConsider, for example, the particle in \n\nFigure 5 which is moving in a straight line with a velocity vector in the xy plane at a position \\vec r relative to the origin. We can define its angular velocity vector relative to the origin, which will be in the positive z direction.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Angular position for a particle moving in a straight line.\n\nThe angular velocity describes the motion of the particle as if it were instantaneously moving along a circle of radius r centred about the origin. The angular velocity is related to the component of \\vec v, v_\\perp, that is perpendicular to \\vec r (which is the component tangent to the circle of radius r, in \n\nFigure 5:||\\vec \\omega|| = \\frac{1}{r^2} || \\vec r \\times \\vec v||=\\frac{v\\sin\\phi}{r}= \\frac{v_\\perp}{r}\n\nwhere ϕ is the angle between \\vec r and \\vec v.\n\nSimilarly, we can define the angular acceleration vector, \\vec \\alpha, about an axis of rotation:\\vec \\alpha = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\vec r \\times \\vec a\n\nwhere \\vec a is the particle’s acceleration vector,  and \\vec r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the particle. The direction of the angular acceleration is co-linear with the axis of rotation and the right-hand rule gives the rotational direction of the angular acceleration. We can also define the angular acceleration about a point; in that case, the direction of the vector will define an instantaneous axis of rotation about a circle of radius r centred at the point as well as the direction of the angular acceleration about that axis.\n\nFinally, we can define an angular displacement vector, \\vec \\theta, relative to an axis of rotation. The direction of the angular displacement vector will be co-linear with the axis of rotation, its direction will indicate the direction of rotation about that axis, and its magnitude (in radians) will correspond to the angular displacement (as shown in \n\nFigure 3). We can only relate the angular displacement vector to an infinitesimal linear displacement vector, d\\vec s, since the position vector \\vec r from the axis of rotation will be different at each end of the displacement vector if the displacement is large. The infinitesimal angular displacement vector that corresponds to an infinitesimal displacement vector, d\\vec s, is defined as:\\begin{align*}\nd\\vec \\theta &= \\frac{1}{r^2} \\vec r \\times d\\vec s\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhich statement is correct regarding an ant on a disk that is rotating slower and slower as illustrated in \n\nFigure 6?\n\n\n\nFigure 6:An ant on a disk.\n\nThe angular velocity points into the page and the angular acceleration points out of the page.\n\nBoth the angular velocity and acceleration point into the page.\n\nBoth the angular velocity and acceleration point out of the page.\n\nThe angular acceleration points into the page and the angular velocity points out of the page.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe instantaneous angular velocity vector is the rate of change of the angular displacement vector:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\omega &= \\frac{d\\vec \\theta}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\vec r \\times d\\vec s = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\vec r \\times \\vec v_s\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\vec v_s is the (instantaneous) tangential velocity around the circle (i.e. the component of the velocity \\vec v that is perpendicular to \\vec r). The angular acceleration vector is the rate of change of the angular velocity vector:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\alpha = \\frac{d}{dt} \\vec \\omega\n\\end{align*}\n\nGiven the angular kinematic quantities, the related linear quantities at a position \\vec r from the axis of rotation are given by:d\\vec s &= d\\vec\\theta \\times \\vec r\\nonumber\\\\\n\\vec v_s &= \\vec \\omega \\times \\vec r\\nonumber\\\\\n\\vec a_s&= \\vec \\alpha \\times \\vec r\n\nwhere the linear quantities are always in the direction perpendicular to \\vec r (tangent to the circle, for motion around a circle). In other words, one cannot, say, take the acceleration vector, obtain the angular acceleration vector, and then get back the original acceleration vector - one will only get back the component of the acceleration vector that is perpendicular to \\vec r.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA particle has an angular velocity in the negative z direction.

The left-hand side of the equation corresponds to the “causes of motion” (much like the sum of the forces in Newton’s Second Law), and the right-hand side of the equation to the inertia and the kinematics. A few things to note when comparing to Newton’s Second Law:\n\nThe rotational quantities, torque and angular acceleration, are only defined with respect to a point or axis of rotation (as this determines the vector \\vec r). If one chooses a different point of rotation, then the torque and angular acceleration will be different.\n\nThe angular acceleration of a particle is proportional to the net torque exerted on it, much like the linear acceleration is proportional to the net force exerted on the particle.\n\nTorque about a centre of rotation can be thought of as the equivalent of a force that causes things rotate about an axis that goes through the point of rotation and that is parallel to the torque/angular acceleration vectors.\n\nInstead of mass, it is mass times r^2 that plays the role of inertia and determines how large of an angular acceleration a particle will experience for a given net torque.\n\nExample 10.1\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A toy rocket accelerating around a circle of radius R, as seen from above.\n\nA toy rocket is attached to a string on a horizontal frictionless table, as shown in \n\nFigure 7. The rocket has a mass m and produces a constant force of thrust with a magnitude F that accelerates the rocket along a circle of radius R (the length of the string). If the rocket starts at rest, what distance along the circumference of the circle will the rocket have travelled after a time, t?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can model the rocket as a point particle of mass m with the following forces exerted on it:\n\n\\vec F, the thrust of the rocket, always acting tangent to the circle.\n\n\\vec T, the force of tension in the string, always acting towards the centre of the circle.\n\n\\vec F_g, the rocket’s weight, acting into the page, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force exerted by the table, out of the page, with magnitude mg.\n\nBecause the normal force and the weight are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the net force will be the sum of the force of thrust and the force of tension, which are always perpendicular to each other. Thinking about this with Newton’s Second Law, we could model the force of thrust as increasing the speed of the particle, while the force of tension keeps the rocket moving in a circle (it can do no work to increase the speed, since it is always perpendicular to the motion).\n\nWe can also think about this in terms of torques and angular acceleration about the centre of the circle. The thrust will result in a net torque about the centre of rotation, which will lead to the rocket having an angular acceleration. By determining the angular acceleration, we can then model the displacement at some time, t, using kinematics. The force of tension will create no torque about the centre of the circle because the force of tension is always co-linear with the position vector, \\vec r (the cross-product of co-linear vectors is always zero).\n\nWe introduce a coordinate system whose origin coincides with the centre of the circle, as shown in \n\nFigure 8, so that \\vec r corresponds to the position of the rocket relative to the origin.  The force of thrust and the tension are also shown in the diagram. We choose the direction of the x axis such that the rocket was located at the intersection of the x axis and the circle at time, t=0.\n\n\n\nFigure 8:Coordinate system to describe the motion of the rocket.\n\nThe net torque on the rocket about the point of rotation is given by the cross-product between the thrust force, \\vec F, and the position vector, \\vec r:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_{net} = \\vec r\\times\\vec F\n\\end{align*}\n\nand will point in the positive z direction (as given by the right hand rule). \\vec r and \\vec F are perpendicular, so the magnitude of the net torque is given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\tau_{net} = rF \\sin(90{\\degree}) = RF\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere R is the magnitude of \\vec r.

A torque is only defined relative to an axis or point of rotation. It never makes sense to say “the torque is ...”, and one should always say \"the torque about this axis/point of rotation is ... \". Angular quantities (torque, angular velocity, angular displacement, etc) are only ever defined relative to a specific axis or point of rotation.\n\nMathematically, the torque vector from a force, \\vec F, exerted at a position, \\vec r, relative to the axis or point of rotation is defined as:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau = \\vec r \\times \\vec F\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that the torque from a given force increases if that force is further from the axis of rotation (if \\vec r has a bigger magnitude).\n\nConsider the solid disk of radius, r, depicted in \n\nFigure 9. The disk can rotate about an axis that passes through the centre of the disk and that is perpendicular to the plane of the disk. A force, \\vec F, is exerted on the edge of the disk as shown.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:A force exerted on the perimeter of a disk that can rotate about an axis that is perpendicular to the disk and that passes through its centre. We can determine the resulting torque by considering either the component of \\vec F that is perpendicular to \\vec r (left panel) or the component of \\vec r that is perpendicular to \\vec F (right panel). The torque vector, \\vec \\tau, is out of the page, as illustrated in the centre.\n\nIntuitively, that force will cause the disk to rotate in the counter-clockwise direction. The torque from the force \\vec F about the axis as rotation is given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau = \\vec r \\times \\vec F\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the vector \\vec r is perpendicular to the axis of rotation and goes from the axis of rotation to the point where \\vec F is exerted. The direction of the torque vector is out of the page (right hand rule, see \n\nFigure 9), and will thus lead to an angular acceleration that is also out of the page, which corresponds to the counter-clockwise direction, as anticipated.\n\nWe can break up the force into components that are parallel (F_\\parallel) and perpendicular (F_\\perp) to the vector \\vec r, as shown on the left panel of \n\nFigure 9. Only the component of the force that is perpendicular to \\vec r will contribute to rotating the disk. Imagine that the force is from a string that you have attached to the perimeter of the disk; if you pull on the string such that the force is parallel to \\vec r, the disk would not rotate. The magnitude of the torque is given by:\\tau = rF\\sin\\phi\n\nwhere ϕ is the angle between \\vec r and \\vec F, as shown in \n\nFigure 9. F \\sin \\phi is precisely the component of \\vec F that is perpendicular to \\vec r, so we could also write the magnitude of the torque as:\\begin{align*}\n\\tau =rF_\\perp\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich highlights that only the component of the force that is perpendicular to \\vec r contributes to the torque. Instead of combining the \\sin \\phi with F to obtain F_\\perp, the component of \\vec F perpendicular to \\vec r, we can instead combine the \\sin \\phi with r in Equation \n\n(28) to obtain r_\\perp, the component of \\vec r that is perpendicular to \\vec F.

Here is an easy way to quickly remind yourself of the two other factors that play a role in whether or not an object will rotate:\n\nTorque about an axis increases if the force is applied further from the axis of rotation.\n\nFirst, pinch the centre of your pencil. Try to make the pencil rotate by pushing right next to where you are pinching. Try making the pencil rotate again, by pushing near the eraser. You should notice that it is much easier to make the pencil rotate by pushing near the eraser, as it is further from the axis of rotation (the pinch).\n\nTorque about an axis is maximized if the force is applied perpendicular to the object.\n\nNext, you should try pushing on the top of the eraser of your pencil, parallel to the pencil. The pencil will not rotate. Now, try pushing on the eraser, but perpendicular to the pencil. In this case, the pencil will rotate.\n\nIf you are ever having trouble remembering the factors involved in maximizing torque about an axis, just grab your pencil case and do this quick exercise.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhy is the handle of a door placed on the side of the door that is opposite to the hinges?}\n\nBecause it increases the lever arm of a force used to rotate the door about the handle.\n\nBecause it increases the perpendicular component of force used to rotate the door about the hinges.\n\nBecause it increases the lever arm of a force used to rotate the door about the hinges.\n\nBecause it would be inconvenient if the handle were next to the hinges.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/rotationaldynamics#sec-rotationaldynamics-torque","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Rotation about an axis versus rotation about a point"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/rotationaldynamics#rotation-about-an-axis-versus-rotation-about-a-point","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Rotation about an axis versus rotation about a point"},"content":"When defining angular quantities (torque, angular acceleration, etc.), it is important to identify whether these are defined relative to an axis or to a point of rotation. This, in turn, determines the vector \\vec r that is involved in the definition of the angular quantities.\n\nConsider a disk of radius r with a force, \\vec F exerted on its perimeter, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 10. The disk can only rotate about an axis that is perpendicular to the disk and that goes through the centre of the disk, like a wheel mounted on an axle. The force has a component, \\vec F_{plane}, that lies in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and a component, \\vec F_{axis}, that is parallel to axis of rotation.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A force exerted on disk that can only rotate about an axis through its centre and perpendicular to its plane. Only the component of \\vec F that is in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, \\vec F_{plane}, will contribute to the torque about the axis of rotation.\n\nThe vector \\vec r is  ** always defined to be perpendicular to the axis of rotation and to go from the axis of rotation to the point where the force \\vec F is exerted**, as illustrated. The torque obtained by taking the cross product:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau = \\vec r \\times \\vec F\n\\end{align*}\n\nwill be perpendicular to both \\vec r and \\vec F, and will thus not be parallel to the axis of rotation. Only the component of the torque that is parallel to the axis of rotation will contribute to rotating the disk about the axis. Only the component of the force that lies in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, \\vec F_{plane}, will contribute to the component of the torque about that axis of rotation. Thus, when we need to determine the torque about an axis of rotation, we can consider vectors \\vec r and \\vec F that lie in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The torque of \\vec F relative to the axis of rotation is thus:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau_{axis} = \\vec r \\times \\vec F_{plane}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFurthermore, only the component of \\vec F_{plane} that is perpendicular to \\vec r will contribute to that torque, as we saw in the previous section.\n\nIn general, solid objects such as a disk can only rotate about an axis. In that case, one can consider only the components of forces that lie in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation in order to calculate the components of the torques about that axis that are parallel to that axis.\n\nA point particle may be able to rotate about any axis that goes through a point of rotation. The net torque vector on the particle about that point will indicate the direction of the axis about which the particle would rotate. This is illustrated in the left panel of \n\nFigure 11.\n\nInstead, if the particle were constrained to rotate about the z axis (e.g. if the particle is on a track), then we would use the component of the torque vector that is parallel to the z axis to describe its motion, as illustrated in the right panel. The z component of the torque could be determined by using only the components of the forces that lie in the plane perpendicular to the axis, and defining the vector \\vec r from the axis to the particle rather than from the point of rotation to the particle.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:Left panel: a particle rotating about a circle centred at the origin with an axis determined from the net torque vector.

Calculate the torque about the z axis as well as the torque about the origin.\n\nSolution\n\nTo calculate the torque about the z axis, we need take the cross-product between the components of the vectors \\vec r and \\vec F that lie in the x-y plane, since that is the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (the z axis). This gives:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_z =(r_x \\hat x + r_y \\hat y) \\times (F_x\\hat x + F_y \\hat y) =(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf instead we want to calculate the torque about the origin, we take the cross-product between the two vectors:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau &=(r_x \\hat x + r_y \\hat y+ r_z\\hat z) \\times (F_x\\hat x + F_y \\hat y+ F_z \\hat z)\\\\\n&=(r_yF_z-r_zF_y)\\hat x+(r_zF_x-r_xF_z)\\hat y+(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf a particle were located at the given position, the force would cause the particle to (instantaneously) rotate about an axis that goes through the origin and is parallel to the torque vector.\n\nDiscussion: This example highlights the difference between calculating the torque about an axis of rotation and determining the torque about a point. When calculating the torque about an axis that goes through the origin, we only consider the components of the vectors \\vec r and \\vec F that are in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This would correspond to a situation in which the particle is constrained to move in a plane that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Instead, if we calculate the torque about the origin, then the torque vector determines the axis of rotation through the origin about which the particle would rotate. In this case, since the axis of rotation is the z axis, and the point of rotation was the origin, the torque about the z axis was simply the z component of the torque calculated about the origin.","type":"content","url":"/rotationaldynamics#rotation-about-an-axis-versus-rotation-about-a-point","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Rotational dynamics for a solid object"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/rotationaldynamics#rotational-dynamics-for-a-solid-object","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Rotational dynamics for a solid object"},"content":"We now consider the rotational dynamics for a solid object about a specific axis of rotation. Just as we did in \n\nChapter 10, we model a solid object as a system made of many particles of mass m_i. Because all of the points in a solid must move in unison, they all rotate about an axis of rotation instead of a point. We describe the position of each particle i by a vector \\vec r_i that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation and goes from the axis to the corresponding particle, as shown in \n\nFigure 12.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:Two point particles that are part of a large solid object and their position vectors relative to an axis of rotation.\n\nWe wish to model the motion of the object as it rotates about a specific axis. Thus, when considering the net torque on any particle i, we only consider the component of the particle’s net torque that is parallel to the axis of rotation (that component of torque that comes from forces that are in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis).\n\nWe can write the rotational version of Newton’s Second Law for particle, i, with mass m_i, and position vector \\vec r_i relative to the rotation axis:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_k \\vec\\tau_{ik} = \\vec\\tau_{i,net} &= m_ir_i^2\\vec\\alpha_i\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\vec\\tau_{ik} is the k-th torque on particle i. \\vec\\tau_{i,net} is the net torque on the particle about the axis of rotation and \\vec\\alpha_i is the particle’s angular acceleration about that axis.\n\nWe can divide the torques exerted on a particle into internal and external torques. Internal torques are those exerted by another particle in the system, whereas external torques are exerted by something external to the system. If particle 1 exerts a torque \\vec\\tau on particle 2, particle 2 will exert an equal and opposite torque, -\\vec\\tau on particle 1.\n\nIndeed, consider the two particles that exert an equal and opposite force (Newton’s Third Law), \\vec F, on each other, and an arbitrary point/axis of rotation, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 13. The torque on particle 1 from the force exerted by particle 2 will have the same magnitude as the torque on particle 2 from the force by particle 1. This is because both forces have the same magnitude and they are co-linear, which results in them having the same lever arm. The torque vector from each force will be in opposite directions, because the forces are in opposite direction. Newton’s Third Law thus also holds for torques.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:Two particles will exert equal and opposite torques on each other due to Newton’s Third Law; the forces exerted by each particle on the other are co-linear and will thus have the same lever arm relative to any point/axis of rotation.\n\nWe can sum together the equations for each particle i:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_{1,net} + \\vec\\tau_{2,net} +\\vec\\tau_{3,net} + \\dots &= m_1r_1^2\\vec\\alpha_1 + m_2r_2^2\\vec\\alpha_2 +m_3r_3^2\\vec\\alpha_3 +\\dots\\\\\n\\sum_i \\vec\\tau_{i,net} &= \\sum_i  m_ir_i^2\\vec\\alpha_i\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere the sum over all of the torques exerted on each particle will be equal to the net external torque exerted on all of the particles, since the sum of the internal torques, \\vec\\tau_{i,int}, will be zero:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_i \\vec\\tau_{i,net} = \\sum_i \\vec\\tau_{i,int} + \\sum_i \\vec\\tau_{i,ext} = \\sum_i \\vec\\tau_{i,ext} = \\vec\\tau_{ext}\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere  \\vec\\tau_{ext} is the net external torque on the system.\n\nAll of the particles are part of the same rigid body, and cannot move relative to each other. Furthermore, they must all move around circles that are centred about the axis of rotation and in a plane perpendicular to that axis. They must thus all have the same angular acceleration, \\vec\\alpha_i = \\vec \\alpha_1 = \\vec \\alpha_2 =\\dots=\\vec\\alpha. We can thus factor the angular acceleration, \\vec \\alpha, out of the sum.\n\nWe can thus write Newton’s Second Law for rotational dynamics of a solid object as:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_i \\vec\\tau_{i,net} &= \\sum_i  m_ir_i^2\\vec\\alpha_i\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec\\tau_{ext}&= \\left(\\sum_i  m_ir_i^2\\right)\\vec\\alpha\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe term in parentheses describes how the various masses are distributed relative to the axis of rotation. The term in parenthesis is called the moment of inertia of the object, and usually denoted with the letter, I:\\boxed{I = \\sum_i  m_ir_i^2}\n\nThe moment of inertia is a property of the object relative to a specific axis of rotation. Re-writing Newton’s Second Law for the rotational dynamics of solid objects using the moment of inertia:\\boxed{\\vec\\tau_{ext} = I\\vec\\alpha}\n\nThe net torque exerted on an object in the direction of the axis of rotation is thus equal to its moment of inertia about that axis multiplied by its angular acceleration about that axis. In other words, the moment of inertia describes how the object will resist rotational motion given a net torque. An object with a smaller moment of inertia will have a larger angular acceleration for a given torque. Again, this is analogous to the linear case, where the acceleration of an object given a net force is determined by its inertial mass.\nex:rotationaldynamics:dumbbell_2m)=\n\nExample 10.3\n\n\n\nFigure 14:A dumbbell made of two small identical masses separated by a distance L.\n\nTwo small point masses, m, are connected by a mass-less rod of length L to form a dumbbell, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 14.\nA net force of magnitude F is exerted on each mass, in opposite directions, as illustrated in the Figure.\n\nWhat is the linear acceleration of the centre of mass of the dumbbell?\n\nWhat is the angular acceleration of the dumbbell relative to an axis that goes through its centre of mass and is perpendicular to the page?\n\nWhat is the angular acceleration of the dumbbell relative to an axis that goes through one of the masses and is perpendicular to the page?\n\nSolution\n\nWe model the dumbbell as a rigid body made of two point masses held at a fixed distance.\n\nThe linear acceleration of the centre of mass must be zero, because the net force on the dumbbell is zero. However, just because the centre of mass does not move does not mean that all parts of the dumbbell are immobile.\n\nFirst, we calculate the angular acceleration relative to an axis that is perpendicular the page and goes through the centre of mass. The centre of mass is located midway between the two masses, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 15. We also define a coordinate system as shown, such that the z axis is out of the page.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:The dumbbell rotating about the centre of mass.\n\nThe vector from the axis of rotation to each mass will have the same magnitude, r, but different directions. The net external torque on the dumbbell relative to the axis that goes through the centre of mass, \\vec\\tau_{ext}, which is equal to the sum of the torques from each force:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_{ext}&= \\vec r \\times \\vec F + (-\\vec r) \\times (-\\vec F) \\\\\n&= 2 (\\vec r \\times \\vec F)=2 (r\\hat x \\times F\\hat y) = 2rF (\\hat x \\times \\hat y)=2rF\\hat z\\\\\n&=LF\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we used the fact that 2r = L. The net torque is thus non zero and in the positive z direction; the dumbbell will have an angular acceleration that is parallel to the net torque, and thus will accelerate in the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nThe moment of inertia of the dumbbell relative to the axis through the centre of mass is given by:\\begin{align*}\nI = \\sum_i  m_ir_i^2 = mr^2 +mr^2 = 2mr^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mL^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nUsing Newton’s Second Law for rotational dynamics, we find the angular acceleration to be:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_{ext}&= I\\vec\\alpha\\\\\nLF\\hat z&=\\frac{1}{2}mL^2\\vec\\alpha\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec\\alpha &= \\frac{2F}{mL}\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nBecause the centre of mass is fixed (the sum of the forces is zero), the two ends of the dumbbell will rotate about an axis that goes through the centre of mass. This is a feature of all situations in which the net force on an object is zero and the net torque about an axis that goes through the centre of mass is non-zero.\n\nLet us now calculate the angular acceleration of the dumbbell about an axis that goes through one of the masses, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 16.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:The dumbbell rotating about one of its ends.\n\nWe first calculate the net torque on the dumbbell. The vector that goes from the axis of rotation to the force exerted on the mass that coincides with the rotation axis is zero. Thus, only the force exerted on the mass that is not at the rotation axis contributes to the net torque:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_{ext}&= \\vec r \\times \\vec F = LF\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe moment of inertia of the dumbbell about this axis is:\\begin{align*}\nI = \\sum_i  m_ir_i^2 = m(0)^2 + m(r^2) = mL^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is larger than it was about the centre of mass. Again, the angular acceleration is found using Newton’s Second Law for rotational dynamics:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_{ext}&= I\\vec\\alpha\\\\\nLF\\hat z&=mL^2\\vec\\alpha\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec\\alpha &= \\frac{F}{mL}\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe find that the angular acceleration is smaller about an axis that goes through one of the mass than it is about an axis through the centre of mass. Because the centre of mass of the dumbbell is fixed, we can only think of the dumbbell as instantaneously rotating about one of its ends; that is, the motion of the dumbbell will not be such that one mass rotates about the other; this is only true instantaneously.\n\nDiscussion: This simple example illustrates several key features about rotational dynamics:\n\nIf the sum of the forces on an object is zero, it does not mean that the entire object is stationary; it only implies that the centre of mass is stationary (or rather, moving with a constant velocity, but we can always choose to model the system in a frame of reference where the centre of mass is stationary).\n\nIf the sum of the forces on an object is zero, and the sum of the external torques is non-zero, the object will rotate about an axis that goes through the centre of mass. That is, all points on the object will move along circles that are centred on an axis that goes through the centre of mass.\n\nWe can model the rotating object about any axis that we choose. In general, the net external torque and the moment of inertia will depend on the choice of axis, as will the resulting angular acceleration.\n\nWhen determining the motion of the centre of mass, we can draw a free-body diagram, and the location of where the forces are exerted do not matter.\n\nWhen determining how the object rotates, we cannot use a free-body diagram, because it matters where the forces are applied (as the torque from a given force depends on the location where the force is applied relative to the axis of rotation).","type":"content","url":"/rotationaldynamics#rotational-dynamics-for-a-solid-object","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Moment of inertia"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/rotationaldynamics#moment-of-inertia","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Moment of inertia"},"content":"In order to model how an object rotates about an axis, we use Newton’s Second Law for rotational dynamics:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau_{ext} = I \\vec \\alpha\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\vec\\tau_{ext} is the net external torque exerted on the object about the axis of rotation, \\vec \\alpha is the angular acceleration of the object, and I is the moment of inertia of the object (about the axis).

The parallel axis theorem allows us to determine the moment of inertia of an object about an axis, if we already know the moment of inertia of the object about an axis that is parallel and goes through the centre of mass of the object.\n\nConsider an object for which we know the moment of inertia, I_{CM}, about an axis that goes through the object’s centre of mass. We define a coordinate system such that the origin is located at the centre of mass, and the z axis is parallel to the axis about which we know the moment of inertia, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 19.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:An object with a coordinate system whose origin is at the object’s centre of mass, and for which we know the moment of inertia about the z axis. We wish to determine the object’s moment of inertia through a second axis, parallel to the z axis, but located a distance h away from the centre of mass.\n\nWe wish to determine the moment of inertia for the object for an axis that is parallel to the z axis, but goes through a point with coordinates (x_0,y_0) located a distance h away from the centre of mass. The moment of inertia about an axis parallel to the z axis and that goes through that point, I_h is given by:\\begin{align*}\nI_h = \\sum_i m_i r_i^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere m_i is a mass element of the object located at a distance r_i from the axis of rotation. If the mass element is located at a position (x_i,y_i) relative to the centre of mass, we can write the distance r_i in terms of the position of the mass element, and of the position of the axis of rotation:\\begin{align*}\nr_i^2 = (x_i-x_0)^2+(y_i-y_0)^2 = x_i^2-2x_ix_0+x_0^2+y_i^2-2y_iy_0+y_0^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that:\\begin{align*}\nx_0^2 + y_0^2 = h^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe moment of inertia, I_h, can thus be written as:\\begin{align*}\nI_h &= \\sum_i m_i r_i^2 =\\sum_i (m_i(x_i^2+ y_i^2)-2x_0m_ix_i-2y_0m_iy_i+m_ih^2)\\\\\n&=\\sum_i m_i(x_i^2+ y_i^2) + h^2\\sum_i m_i - 2x_0 \\sum_im_ix_i- 2y_0 \\sum_im_iy_i\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we broke the sum up into several sums, and factored constant terms (h, x_0, y_0) out of the sums, since these constants do not depend on which mass element we are considering. The first term is the moment of inertia about the centre of mass, since x_i^2+y_i^2 is the distance to the centre of mass. The second term is h^2 times the total mass of the object, since the sum of all the m_i is just the mass, M, of the object. Now consider the term:\\begin{align*}\n-2x_0 \\sum_im_ix_i\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe sum, \\sum m_i x_i is the numerator in the definition of the x coordinate of the centre of mass! The sum is thus zero, because we choose the origin to be located at the centre of mass. The last two terms in the sum are thus identically zero, because they correspond to the x and y coordinates of the centre of mass!\n\nWe can thus write the parallel axis theorem:\\boxed{I_h = I_{CM} + Mh^2}\n\nwhere I_{CM} is the moment of inertia of an object of mass M about an axis that goes through the centre of mass and, I_h, is the moment of inertia about a second axis that is parallel to the first and a distance h away.\n\nExample 10.5\n\nIn the previous section, we calculated the moment of inertia of a rod of length L and mass M through an axis that is perpendicular to the rod and through one of its ends, and found that it was given by:\\begin{align*}\nI=\\frac{1}{3}ML^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhat is the moment of inertia of the rod about an axis that is perpendicular to the rod and goes through its centre of mass?\n\nSolution\n\nIn this case, we know the moment of inertia through an axis that does not go through the centre of mass. The centre of mass is located a distance h=L/2 away from the point about which we know the moment of inertia, I_h.\n\nUsing the parallel axis theorem, we can find the moment of inertia through the centre of mass:\\begin{align*}\nI_{CM} &= I_h - Mh^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 - M \\left( \\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{12}ML^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nDiscussion: We find that the moment of inertia about the centre of mass is smaller than the moment of inertia about the end of the rod.

The z axis is not illustrated, and is directed out of the page.\n\n\n\nFigure 21:Forces exerted on the plank.\n\nAll of the forces are in the y direction, so we only write the y component of Newton’s Second Law (with zero acceleration), which allows us to determine the magnitude of the normal force:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum F_y = N - Mg -m_1g - m_2 g &=0\\\\\n\\therefore N &= (M+m_1+m_2) g\n\\end{align*}\n\nBecause the plank is in static equilibrium, the sum of the torques must also be zero. We can choose the axis of rotation about which to calculate the torques. We choose an axis that is parallel to the z axis (out of the page) and goes through the fulcrum. In general, since we can choose the axis of rotation, it is usually convenient to choose an axis that goes through a point where at least one force is being exerted, because the torque from that force will be zero (its lever arm will be zero).  Furthermore, since all of the forces are in the xy plane, the net torque on the plank will be in the z direction, so it makes sense to choose an axis in that direction.\n\nThe torques from the weight of the plank and from the force exerted by mass m_2 will be in the negative z direction, and the torque from the force exerted by mass m_1 will be in the positive z direction. The normal force will not result in any torque, because it is exerted at the axis of rotation and has a lever arm of zero.\n\nWe define \\vec r_1 as the vector from the fulcrum to mass m_1. The torque, \\vec \\tau_1, from the force exerted by mass m_1 is given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau_1 &= \\vec r_1 \\times \\vec F_1 = (-r_1 \\hat x) \\times (-F_1 \\hat y) \\\\\n&= r_1F_1(\\hat x \\times \\hat y) = r_1F_1\\hat z=r_1m_1g\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere we used the fact that the magnitude of \\vec F_1 is m_1 g. Similarly, the torques from the force exerted by m_2, \\vec\\tau_2, and by the weight, \\vec\\tau_g, are given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau_2 &=\\vec r_2 \\times \\vec F_2 = -m_2 g r_2 \\hat z\\\\\n\\vec \\tau_g &=\\vec r \\times \\vec F_g=-rMg\\hat z = -\\left(\\frac{L}{2}-d\\right)Mg\\hat z\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\frac{L}{2}-d is the distance between the fulcrum and where the weight of the plank is exerted. We require that the z component of the net torque be equal to zero (since all of the torques are in the z direction), which allows us to determine r_2:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum \\tau_z = \\tau_{1z} + \\tau_{2z} + \\tau_{gz} &=0\\\\\nm_1 g r_1 -m_2 g r_2 -\\left(\\frac{L}{2}-d\\right)Mg &=0\\\\\n\\therefore r_2 = \\frac{1}{m_2} \\left(m_1r_1-\\left(\\frac{L}{2}-d\\right)M\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that because we chose to calculate the torques about a point that goes through the fulcrum, in this case, we did not need to determine the value of the normal force which we obtained from Newton’s Second Law.\n\nDiscussion: This example highlights the fact that when an object is in static equilibrium, we can choose a convenient axis about which to calculate the torques. In this case, by calculating the torques about the fulcrum, we did not need to consider the torque from the normal force. If we had chosen a different point, then the torque from the normal force would have been non-zero, and we would have used Newton’s Second Law to express the normal force in terms of the other quantities. Physically, if we had placed the fulcrum at the centre of the plank d = L/2, then we would have found that m_1r_1 = m_2r_2, the well known equation for a balance. This equation, of course, comes from requiring that the torques from the forces exerted by m_1 and m_2 are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.","type":"content","url":"/rotationaldynamics#static-equilibrium","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl3":"Dynamic equilibrium","lvl2":"Equilibrium"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/rotationaldynamics#dynamic-equilibrium","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl3":"Dynamic equilibrium","lvl2":"Equilibrium"},"content":"Review\n\nBefore proceeding, you may wish to review \n\nSection  on inertial forces.\n\nWhen an object is in dynamic equilibrium, its centre of mass is accelerating, but the object is not rotating when viewed from its centre of mass frame of reference. Thus, the sum of the external forces exerted on the object is not zero, while the net external torque exerted on the object is zero, in the frame of reference of the centre of mass.\n\nConsider, for example, a speed skater going around a circular track of radius R, and leaning into the centre making an angle θ with the ice, as depicted in \n\nFigure 22. The skater’s centre of mass is accelerating, because she is going around a circle, so the net force on the skater is not zero. However, in the reference frame of the skater, the skater is not rotating; she is thus in dynamic equilibrium.\n\n\n\nFigure 22:A speed skater leaning in as she goes around a circle.\n\nThe forces on the skater are:\n\n\\vec F_g, her weight, exerted at her centre of mass with magnitude, Mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force, exerted by the ice upwards on her skates.\n\n\\vec f_s, a force of static friction, exerted towards the centre of the circle, by the ice on her skates.\n\nThe forces are illustrated in \n\nFigure 23 along with our choice of coordinate system.\n\n\n\nFigure 23:Forces on the speed skater from \n\nFigure 22.\n\nThe sum of the forces exerted on the skater must be towards the centre of the circle and equal to the mass of the skater times her centripetal acceleration (which is the acceleration of her centre of mass, \\vec a_{CM}). The x and y components of Newton’s Second Law are thus given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum F_x &= -f_s = -ma_{CM} = m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n\\sum F_y &= N-mg = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nAll of the forces exerted on the skater are in the xy plane, so we consider torques about an axis that is co-linear with the z axis. Consider the torques about an axis through the point of contact between the skates and the ice; there is a net torque in the counter-clockwise direction due to the weight of the skater (the weight is the only force that can result in a torque about the point of contact with the ice). We expect that the skater would topple over, however, this must not be a correct model for the skater, since we know that it is possible for her to lean in without falling.\n\nConsider, instead, the sum of the torques about an axis through her centre of mass. If the skater has a length L and the centre of mass is in the middle of the skater, the sum of the torques about the centre of mass is given by the torques from the normal forces and the force of friction:\\begin{align*}\n\\sum \\tau = \\tau_{Nz} + \\tau_{f_sz} = \\frac{L}{2}\\cos\\theta N - \\frac{L}{2}\\sin\\theta f_s\n\\end{align*}\n\nAbout the centre of mass, the torques must be zero for the skater not to rotate, and this would give a relation between the force of static friction and the normal force.\n\nWhy do we get an incorrect model when we take the torques about the point of contact between the ice and the skater? In order to determine if the skater is rotating, we need to be in the same reference frame as the skater. However, the frame of reference of the skater is not an inertial frame of reference, since the skater is accelerating. We can still model the forces on the skater in the non-accelerating frame of reference, as long as we include the inertial force, -m\\vec a_{CM}, in that frame of reference. In the frame of reference of the skater, there is an additional inertial force, -m\\vec a_{CM}, in order for the sum of the forces to be zero (in the frame of reference of the skater, the sum of the forces must be zero since the skater is not accelerating in that frame of reference). The additional inertial force is exerted at the centre of mass, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 24.\n\n\n\nFigure 24:Forces on the speed skater from \n\nFigure 22 as seen in the accelerating frame of reference of the centre of mass.\n\nThe reason that our model worked when taking the torques about the centre of mass is that the inertial force, exerted at the centre of mass, does not result in a torque (since it has a lever arm of zero). Our model was technically wrong, but if we take the torques about the centre of mass, then we do not need to worry about the inertial force. If we include the additional inertial force, then we can take the torques about any point, just as in the static equilibrium case.","type":"content","url":"/rotationaldynamics#dynamic-equilibrium","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/rotationaldynamics#summary","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 10 - Rotational dynamics","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"We can describe the kinematics of rotational motion using vectors to indicate both an axis of rotation and the direction of rotation about that axis. If a particle with velocity vector, \\vec v, is rotating in an circle about an axis, then its angular velocity vector, \\vec\\omega, relative to that axis is defined as:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\omega = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\vec r \\times \\vec v\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\vec r is a vector from the axis of rotation to the particle. The particle rotates in a circle that lies in the plane defined by \\vec r and \\vec v, perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The direction of the angular velocity vector is co-linear with the axis of rotation and the direction of rotation is given by the right-hand rule for axial vectors.\n\nOne can define the angular velocity of a particle relative to a point of rotation, even if the particle is not moving in a circle. In that case, the angular velocity corresponds to the angular velocity of the particle as if it were instantaneously moving about a circle.\n\nIf a particle moving around a circle has a tangential acceleration, \\vec a_s, then its angular acceleration vector is defined as:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\alpha = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\vec r \\times \\vec a_s\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe torque from a force, \\vec F, exerted at a position \\vec r, relative to an axis (or point) of rotation is defined as:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec\\tau &= \\vec r \\times \\vec F\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTorque is analogous to force in that it is used to model the causes of motion. Torques are only ever defined relative to an axis or point of rotation. The torque vector will be co-linear with the axis about which the object on which the force is exerted would rotate as a result of that force.\n\nThe magnitude of the torque can be written using either the component of the force, F_\\perp perpendicular to the vector \\vec r, or the lever arm, r_\\perp, of the force relative to the axis of rotation:\\begin{align*}\n\\tau &= rF\\sin\\phi\\\\\n&=rF_\\perp\\\\\n&=r_\\perp F\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere ϕ is the angle between the vectors \\vec r and \\vec F when these are placed ``tail to tail’'.\n\nUsing rotational/angular quantities, we can modify Newton’s Second Law to describe rotational dynamics about a given axis (or point) of rotation. For a point particle, this gives:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau_{net} = mr^2 \\vec\\alpha\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere \\vec \\tau_{net} is the net torque on the particle (the sum of the torques from each force exerted on the particle) about the axis, and \\vec\\alpha is the resulting angular acceleration about that axis.\n\nFor an object (either continuous or made of point particles), the rotational version of Newton’s Second Law for rotation about a specific axis is given by:\\begin{align*}\n\\vec \\tau_{net} = I\\vec\\alpha\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the object about that axis.\n\nThe moment of inertia of an object about an axis of rotation is given by\\begin{align*}\nI = \\sum_i m_ir_i^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nif the object is modelled as a system of point particles of mass m_i each a distance r_i from the axis of rotation. For a continuous object, the moment of inertia is given by:\\begin{align*}\nI = \\int r^2 dm\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere dm is a small mass element a distance r from the axis of rotation and the integral is over the dimension of the object. Generally, one can set up the integral by expressing dm in terms of r using the density of the object, and then integrating r over the dimension of the object.\n\nIf the moment of inertia of an object of mass M about an axis that goes through the centre of mass is given by I_{CM}, then the moment of inertia, I_h, of the object through an axis that is parallel and a distance h from the centre of mass is given by the parallel axis theorem:\\begin{align*}\nI_h = I_{CM} + Mh^2 \\quad \\text{Parallel axis theorem}\n\\end{align*}\n\nObjects are in equilibrium if they are not rotating when viewed in their centre of mass frame of reference. Thus, for an object to be in equilibrium, the sum of the torques on the object, in the centre of mass reference frame, must be zero.\n\nAn object is in static equilibrium if the centre of mass is not accelerating, and thus the sum of the external forces on the object is zero. To model the torques on an object in static equilibrium, one can choose the axis about which to calculate the torques. A good choice is to choose an axis that is perpendicular to the plane in which the forces on the object are exerted (if such a plane exists), and to choose the axis to go through a point where at least one force is exerted (so that torques exerted at that point are identically zero).\n\nAn object is in dynamic equilibrium if the centre of mass is accelerating, but the object does not rotate when viewed in the frame of reference of its centre of mass.

Consider the motion of a wheel of radius, R, rotating with angular velocity, \\vec\\omega, about an axis perpendicular to the wheel and through its centre of mass, as observed in the centre of mass frame. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:A wheel rotating with angular velocity \\vec\\omega about an axis through its centre of mass.\n\nIn the frame of reference of the centre of mass, each point on the edge of the wheel has a velocity, \\vec v_{rot}, due to rotation given by:\\vec v_{rot} = \\vec \\omega\\times \\vec r\n\nwhere \\vec r is a vector (of magnitude R) from the centre of mass to the corresponding point on the edge of the wheel (shown in \n\nFigure 3 for a point on the lower left of the wheel). The vector \\vec r is always perpendicular to \\vec \\omega, so that the speed of all points on the edge, as measured in the frame of reference of the centre of mass, is the same:v_{rot} = \\omega R\n\nas illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.\n\nNow, suppose that the whole wheel is moving, as it rolls on the ground, such that the centre of mass of the wheel moves with a velocity, \\vec v_{CM}, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A wheel rolling without slipping on the ground, with the centre of mass moving with velocity \\vec v_{CM}.\n\nThe wheel is shown at different instants in time, as the point shown in red moves around the centre of mass.}\nIn the frame of reference of the ground, each point on the edge of the wheel will have a velocity \\vec v given by:\\vec v = \\vec v_{rot} + \\vec v_{CM}\n\nThat is, in the frame reference of the ground, each point will have a velocity obtained by (vectorially) adding its velocity relative to the centre of mass, \\vec v_{rot}, and the velocity of the centre of mass relative to the ground, \\vec v_{CM}. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 4 for one specific point, shown in red. The red vector corresponds to the velocity of the red point as the wheel rotates, and is obtained by adding the velocity of the centre of mass, \\vec v_{CM}, and the velocity, \\vec v_{rot}, relative to the centre of mass (shown as the dashed vector, tangent to the edge of the wheel).\n\nConsider, specifically, the instant in time when the red point is at the bottom of the wheel, where the wheel makes contact with the ground. If the wheel is not slipping with respect to the ground, then the point is, at that instant, at rest relative to the ground. We call this type of motion “rolling without slipping”; the point on the rotating object that is in contact with the ground is instantaneously at rest relative to the ground. This is the scenario illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.\n\nFor the point in contact with the ground, the vectors \\vec v_{rot} and \\vec v_{CM} are anti-parallel, horizontal, and must sum to zero. Writing out the horizontal component of the velocity of that point (choosing the positive direction to be in the direction of the velocity of the centre of mass):v &= -v_{rot} + v_{CM} = 0\\\\\n\\therefore v_{rot} &= v_{CM}\n\nand we find that, for rolling without slipping, the speed due to rotation about the centre of mass has to be equal to the speed of the centre of mass. The speed due to rotation about the centre of mass can be expressed using the angular velocity of the wheel about the centre of mass (\n\n(26)). For rolling without slipping, we thus have the following relationship between angular velocity and the speed of the centre of mass:\\boxed{\\omega R = v_{CM}}\\quad \\text{(rolling without slipping)}\n\nIt makes sense for the angular velocity to be related to the speed of the centre of mass. The faster the wheel rotates, the faster the centre of mass will move. If the wheel is slipping with respect to the ground, then the point of contact is no longer stationary relative to the ground, and there is no relation between the angular velocity and the speed of the centre of mass. For rolling with slipping, imagine the motion of your bicycle wheel as you try to ride your bike on a slick sheet of ice.\n\nFor rolling without slipping, the magnitude of the linear acceleration of the centre of mass, a_{CM}, is similarly related to the magnitude of the angular acceleration of the wheel, α, about the centre of mass:a_{CM} &= \\frac{dv_{CM}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\omega R = R \\frac{d\\omega}{dt}\\\\\n\\therefore a_{CM} &= R\\alpha\n\nCheckpoint\n\nFor rolling without slipping (\n\nFigure 4), the speed of the point on the wheel that is in contact with the ground is 0.

The incline makes an angle θ with respect to the horizontal, as shown in \n\nFigure 5. If the disk starts at rest and rolls without slipping down the incline, what speed will the centre of mass have when the disk reaches the bottom of the incline?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can use the conservation of mechanical energy to determine the speed of the centre of mass at the bottom of the incline, as there are no non-conservative forces doing work on the disk. If we choose to define gravitational potential energy such that it is zero at the bottom of the incline, we can write the total mechanical energy of the disk at the top of the incline as:E = K+U=(0)+Mgh\n\nwhere the kinetic energy is zero, since the disk starts at rest. At the bottom of the incline, the disk will have only kinetic energy, since the potential energy at the bottom is defined to be zero. The kinetic energy of the disk will have a component from the rotation of the disk about the centre of mass, with angular speed ω, and a component from the translation of the centre of mass with speed v_{CM}. The mechanical energy at the bottom of the incline is thus:E' = K' + U = K'_{rot}+K'_{trans}+(0)=\\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\\omega^2 + \\frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2\n\nSince the disk is rolling without slipping, its angular speed is related to the speed of centre of mass:\\omega = \\frac{v_{CM}}{R}\n\nThe moment of inertia of the disk about its centre of mass is given by:I_{CM}=\\frac{1}{2}MR^2\n\nWe can thus write the mechanical energy at the bottom of the incline as:E' &= \\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\\omega^2 + \\frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(  \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 \\right) \\left(  \\frac{v_{CM}}{R}\\right)^2+ \\frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{3}{4}Mv_{cm}^2\n\nApplying conservation of energy allows us to determine the speed of the centre of mass at the bottom of the incline:E &= E'\\\\\nMgh &= \\frac{3}{4}Mv_{cm}^2\\\\\n\\therefore v_{CM} &= \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}gh}\n\nDiscussion: This example showed how we can use the conservation of energy to model the motion of an object that is rolling without slipping. The constraint of rolling without slipping allowed for the angular speed of the object to be related to the speed of its centre of mass.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA hoop, a disk, and a sphere roll without slipping down an incline.

However, because the point of contact between the rolling object and the ground is stationary, we can also model the motion as if the object were instantaneously rotating with angular velocity, \\vec \\omega, about a stationary axis through the point of contact. That is, we can model the motion as rotation only, with no translation, if we choose an axis of rotation through the point of contact between the ground and the wheel.\n\nWe call the axis through the point of contact the “instantaneous axis of rotation”, since, instantaneously, it appears as if the whole wheel is rotating about that point. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 6, which shows, in red, the velocity vector for each point on the edge of the wheel, relative to the instantaneous axis of rotation. Because the axis of rotation is fixed to the ground, the velocity of each point about that axis of rotation corresponds to the same velocity relative to the ground that is depicted in \n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A wheel that is rolling without slipping, as viewed if rotating about the instantaneous axis of rotation that passes through the point of contact with the ground.\n\nIn particular, the angular velocity, \\vec \\omega, about the instantaneous axis of rotation is the same as when we model the motion as translation plus rotation about the centre of mass ,as in the previous section. Indeed, relative to the instantaneous axis of rotation, the centre of mass must still have a velocity \\vec v_{CM}, which is given by:\\vec v_{CM} &= \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec r_{CM}\\\\\n\\therefore v_{CM} &= \\omega R\n\nwhere \\vec r_{CM} is the vector from the axis of rotation to the centre of mass. This is the same condition for rolling without slipping that we found before. Similarly, the velocity of any point on the wheel, relative to the ground, is given by:\\vec v = \\vec\\omega \\times \\vec r\n\nwhere \\vec r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point of interest (shown in \n\nFigure 6 for the point on the right side of the wheel). In particular, the velocity vector (in red) for any point is always perpendicular to the vector \\vec r for that point, which was not necessarily obvious when modelling the motion as rotation plus translation, as in \n\nFigure 4.\n\nExample 11.2\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A disk rolling without slipping down an incline.\n\nA disk of mass M and radius R is placed on an incline at a height h above the ground. The incline makes an angle θ with respect to the horizontal, as shown in \n\nFigure 7. What is the angular acceleration of the disk, about an axis through its centre of mass, as it rolls without slipping down the slope?\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to determine the angular acceleration of the disk about the centre of mass, we need to model the forces that are exerted on the disk. The forces exerted on the disk are:\n\n\\vec F_g, the weight of the disk, exerted downwards at the centre of mass, with magnitude Mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force perpendicular to the incline, exerted by the incline at the point of contact with the disk.\n\n\\vec f_s, a force of static friction parallel to the incline, exerted by the incline at the point of contact with the disk. Without this force, the disk would simply slide down the incline without rotating.\n\nThese forces are illustrated in \n\nFigure 8, along with the acceleration of the centre of mass, and our choice of coordinate system (we choose the x axis parallel to the acceleration of the centre of mass, to facilitate applying Newton’s Second Law).\n\n\n\nFigure 8:The forces on the disk rolling without slipping down an incline.\n\nThe angular acceleration of the disk about the centre of mass, \\vec \\alpha is given by Newton’s Second Law for rotational dynamics:\\vec\\tau^{ext} = I_{CM}\\vec\\alpha\n\nwhere \\vec\\tau^{ext} is the net external torque on the disk about the centre of mass (which will be in the negative z direction).\n\nThe only force that can exert a torque about the centre of mass is the force of static friction. Gravity has a lever arm of zero and the normal force is anti-parallel to the vector that goes from the centre of mass to the point where the force is exerted. The net torque about the centre of mass is thus:\\vec\\tau^{ext} = \\vec \\tau_{f_s} = \\vec r_{f_s}\\times \\vec f_s= -Rf_s\\hat z\n\nThe angular acceleration will thus be in the negative z direction, and the magnitude is given by:\\alpha = \\frac{\\tau^{ext}}{I_{CM}}=\\frac{Rf_s}{\\frac{1}{2}MR^2}=\\frac{2f_s}{MR}\n\nHowever, we do not know the magnitude of the force of static friction. We can use the x and y components of Newton’s Second Law to determine it (with acceleration of the centre of mass in the x direction):\\sum F_x &= F_g\\sin\\theta - f_s = Ma_{CM}\\\\\n\\sum F_y &= N - F_g\\cos\\theta = 0\n\nBecause the disk is rolling without slipping, the acceleration of the centre of mass is related to the angular acceleration of the disk:a_{cm} = \\alpha R\n\nThe x component of Newton’s Second Law can thus be used to determine the magnitude of the force of static friction in terms of the angular acceleration:Mg\\sin\\theta - f_s &= M \\alpha R\\\\\n\\therefore f_s &= Mg\\sin\\theta - M\\alpha R\n\nWe can then substitute out the force of friction from our previous formula for the angular acceleration:\\alpha &= \\frac{2f_s}{MR}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2Mg\\sin\\theta - 2M\\alpha R}{MR} = \\frac{2g\\sin\\theta}{R} - 2\\alpha \\\\\n\\therefore \\alpha &= \\frac{2g\\sin\\theta}{3R}\n\nInstead of modelling the motion of the disk  as rotation about the centre of mass and translation of the center of mass, we can also model it about the instantaneous axis of rotation.\n\nThe angular acceleration about the instantaneous axis of rotation will be the same as the angular acceleration about the centre of mass. About the instantaneous axis of rotation, only the force of gravity can exert a torque, since the normal force and the force of friction both have a lever arm of zero. The torque from the force of gravity, about the instantaneous axis of rotation is:\\vec \\tau_g = -F_gR\\sin\\theta \\hat z = -MgR\\sin\\theta \\hat z\n\nThe torque from the force of gravity is equal to the moment of inertia of the disk about the instantaneous axis of rotation, I, multiplied by its angular acceleration:\\tau ^{ext} = \\tau_g &= I\\alpha\\\\\n\\therefore \\alpha &= \\frac{\\tau_g}{I} = \\frac{MgR\\sin\\theta}{I}\n\nThe moment of inertia about the instantaneous axis of rotation is easily found using the parallel axis theorem:I = I_{CM}+MR^2 = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + MR^2 =\\frac{3}{2}MR^2\n\nThis allows us to find the angular acceleration of the disk:\\alpha &= \\frac{MgR\\sin\\theta}{I} = \\frac{MgR\\sin\\theta}{\\frac{3}{2}MR^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2g\\sin\\theta}{3R}\n\nas we found previously, but in this case, we did not need to use Newton’s Second Law to determine the force of friction.\n\nDiscussion: We saw that we can model the dynamics of the rolling body using either an axis through the centre of mass, or an axis through the instantaneous axis of rotation. The latter was easier in this case, because it did not require using Newton’s Second Law.\n\nBy using an axis through the centre of mass to model the motion of the disk, it was clear that the force of static friction is required in order for the disk to rotate. Without the force of static friction, the disk would slide along the surface of the incline. The disk could still rotate if there is a force of kinetic friction that causes a torque that rotates the disk. If the surface were completely frictionless, the disk would simply slide down the incline, and we could model it as a sliding block. If the incline is too steep the force of static friction is no longer sufficient to provide the necessary torque required for the angular acceleration to be that which corresponds to rolling without slipping, and the disk would slip.","type":"content","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#the-instantaneous-axis-of-rotation","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#angular-momentum","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"content":"In this section, we show that we can define a quantity called “angular momentum” as the rotational equivalent of the linear momentum.","type":"content","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#angular-momentum","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl3":"Angular momentum of a particle","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#angular-momentum-of-a-particle","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl3":"Angular momentum of a particle","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"content":"The angular momentum relative to a point of rotation, \\vec L, of a particle with linear momentum, \\vec p, is defined as:\\boxed{\\vec L = \\vec r\\times \\vec p}\n\nwhere \\vec r is the vector from the point of rotation to the particle, and the linear momentum, \\vec p, is defined relative to an inertial frame of reference in which the point of rotation is at rest.\n\nConsider the time-derivative of angular momentum (where we have to use the product rule for derivatives):\\frac{d\\vec L}{dt}  &= \\frac{d}{dt} (\\vec r\\times \\vec p)\\\\\n&=\\frac{d\\vec r}{dt}\\times \\vec p + \\vec r\\times\\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}\\\\\n&=\\vec v\\times \\vec p + \\vec r\\times\\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}\\\\\n\nThe first term is zero, since \\vec v is parallel to \\vec p by definition.

The net torque on a particle is thus equal to the rate of change of its angular momentum. In particular, the angular momentum of a particle will remain constant (not change with time) if the net torque on the particle is zero.\n\nWe can also define the angular momentum of a particle using only angular quantities:\\vec L = \\vec r \\times \\vec p =  m \\vec r \\times \\vec v = mr^2 \\vec\\omega\n\nwhere we factored the mass m out of the momentum and used the definition \\vec \\omega = 1/r^2(\\vec r \\times \\vec v).

If no net torque is exerted on the particle about that point, then the particle’s angular momentum about that point will remain constant. We can also consider the torque and angular momentum about an axis instead of a point; in that case, we would simply take the components of torque and angular momentum that are parallel to that axis.\n\nExample 11.3\n\n\n\nFigure 9:A small block attached to a mass-less string moving in a horizontal circle on a table.\n\nA small block of mass m attached to a mass-less string is moving along a circle of radius R on a horizontal table, as depicted from above in \n\nFigure 9. If the table is frictionless: are the block’s linear and/or angular momentum with respect to the axis of rotation conserved? If there is friction between the table and the block, are the block’s linear and/or angular momentum with respect to the axis of rotation conserved? What can you say about the kinetic energy of the block in the two cases?\n\nSolution\n\nIf there is no friction between the block and the table, then the forces exerted on the block are:\n\n\\vec F_g, the block’s weight, exerted downwards, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec N, a normal force, exerted upwards, with magnitude mg.\n\n\\vec T, a force of tension, exerted towards the centre of the circle.\n\nAll of these forces are perpendicular to the (tangential) displacement of the block along the circle. Thus, there can be no work done on the block and its speed, v, must remain constant. The kinetic energy of the block must thus remain constant.\n\nThe sum of the forces on the block must be towards the centre of the circle, since the block is in uniform circular motion. The linear momentum of the block cannot be conserved if there is a net force on the block (and clearly, the block’s velocity vector changes direction as it goes around the circle).\n\nThe forces of weight and the normal force are both outside of the plane of motion, and thus cannot exert a torque along the axis of rotation. They are also equal and opposite in magnitude so the net torque from those two forces is always zero (since the net force from those forces is zero). The force of tension is always anti-parallel to the vector \\vec r, from the axis of rotation to the particle, and cannot result in a torque about the rotation axis. Thus, the net torque on the block is zero and its angular momentum must be conserved.\n\nIf there is kinetic friction exerted by the table on the block, then there is an additional force, \\vec f_s, exerted on the block in the direction opposite of motion (tangent to the circle, in the opposite direction from the block’s velocity).\n\nThe force of friction will do negative work on the block, slowing it down and reducing its kinetic energy, which is no longer conserved. The net force on the block is non-zero, so its linear momentum is still not conserved. Finally, the force of friction, which is always perpendicular to \\vec r, will result in a torque that reduces the angular velocity of the block. The block’s angular momentum is thus no longer conserved when there is friction between the table and the block.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we saw that kinetic energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum are all conserved under different conditions. Kinetic energy is conserved if no net work is done on the block. Linear momentum is conserved if the net force on the block is zero. Angular momentum is conserved if the net torque on the block is zero. By introducing angular momentum, we are able to use a new conserved quantity to help us model rotational dynamics.\n\nExample 11.4\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A particle moving in a straight line.\n\nA particle is moving with constant velocity \\vec v (in a straight line) relative to a coordinate system in an inertial frame of reference, as shown in \n\nFigure 10. Show that its angular momentum about the origin is conserved.\n\nSolution\n\nIn this case, the particle is moving in a straight line, but we can still define its angular momentum relative to the origin. If \\vec r is the position vector of the particle relative to the origin, its angular momentum is:\\vec L = \\vec r \\times \\vec p\n\nWe can take the time derivative of the angular momentum to see if it changes with time:\\frac{d\\vec L}{dt} = &= \\frac{d}{dt} (\\vec r\\times \\vec p)\\\\\n&=\\frac{d\\vec r}{dt}\\times \\vec p + \\vec r\\times\\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}\\\\\n&=\\vec v\\times \\vec p + \\vec r\\times\\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}\\\\\n\nThe first term is zero because \\vec v and \\vec p are parallel (so their cross-product must be zero). The second term is zero because the particle’s momentum is constant in time (since its velocity is constant). Thus, the particle’s angular momentum does not change with time, and it is conserved.\n\nDiscussion: Of course, we expected this result since no net torque is exerted on the particle. It is however worth highlighting that a particle does not need to be rotating for its angular momentum about a given axis to be defined or conserved; all that matters is that there is no net torque on the particle relative to that axis.","type":"content","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#angular-momentum-of-a-particle","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl3":"Angular momentum of an object or system","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#angular-momentum-of-an-object-or-system","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl3":"Angular momentum of an object or system","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"content":"Consider a system made of many particles of mass, m_i, each with a position, \\vec r_i, and velocity, \\vec v_i, relative to a point of rotation that is fixed in an inertial frame of reference.\n\nWe can write Newton’s Second Law using the angular momentum, \\vec L_i, for particle i:\\frac{d\\vec L_i}{dt} = \\vec \\tau_i^{net}\n\nwhere \\vec \\tau_i^{net} is the net torque exerted on particle i. We can sum each side of this equation for all of the particles in the system:\\frac{d\\vec L_1}{dt} + \\frac{d\\vec L_2}{dt} + \\frac{d\\vec L_3}{dt} + \\dots &= \\vec \\tau_1^{net} + \\vec \\tau_2^{net} +\\vec \\tau_3^{net} + \\dots\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_i\\vec L_i &= \\sum_i \\vec \\tau_i^{net}\n\nThe sum of all of the torques on all of the particles will include a sum over torques that are internal to the system and torques that are external to the system. The sum over internal torques is zero:\\sum_i \\vec\\tau_i^{net} = \\sum_i \\vec\\tau_i^{int} + \\sum_i \\vec\\tau_i^{ext} = \\sum_i \\vec\\tau_i^{ext} = \\vec\\tau^{ext}\n\nwhere we defined, \\vec\\tau^{ext}, to be the net external torque exerted on the system. We also introduce the total angular momentum of the system, \\vec L, as the sum of the angular momenta of the individual particles:\\vec L = \\sum_i\\vec L_i\n\nThe rate of change of the total angular momentum of the system is then given by:\\boxed{\\frac{d\\vec L}{dt} = \\vec \\tau^{ext}}\n\nUp to this point, we did not require that the system be a solid object, so the particles in the system can move relative to each other. For example, the particles could be the Sun, planets, and everything else that is in our Solar System. The total angular momentum of all of the bodies in the Solar System (say, relative to the Sun) is conserved if there is no net torque on the solar system relative to the Sun (i.e. if there is no torque about the Sun exerted on any of the bodies in the system that is not exerted by one of the other bodies in the system).\n\nNow, consider a solid object that is modelled as a system of many particles of mass, m_i, at position, \\vec r_i, with velocity, \\vec v_i, relative to a fixed axis of rotation. We can define the angular momentum of a single particle as equation \n\n(56):\\vec L_i = m_i r_i^2 \\vec \\omega_i\n\nThe total momentum of the system is the sum of the angular momenta of the individual particles:\\vec L &= \\sum_i\\vec L_i = \\sum_i  m_i r_i^2 \\vec \\omega_i\n\nBecause all of the particles are part of the same object, they must all move in unison and have the same angular velocity, \\vec\\omega, relative to the axis of rotation. We can thus define the angular momentum about the rotation axis for a solid object with angular velocity, \\vec\\omega, as:\\boxed{\\vec L = \\left(\\sum_i  m_i r_i^2\\right) \\vec \\omega = I\\vec\\omega}\n\nwhere we recognized that the sum in parentheses is simply the moment of inertia of the object relative to the axis of rotation. Again, it should be emphasized that this is the total angular momentum of the object about an axis of rotation, and not about a point.\n\nVisualizing the torque and angular momentum of a system can be challenging because it almost always requires visualizing something in three dimensions. Consider a wheel (e.g. a bicycle wheel) that is spinning about horizontal axle which you hold with your hands, as illustrated in the left panel of \n\nFigure 11 (without the hands). Imagine that you are holding onto the axle so that the wheel is front of you, your right hand is to the right of the wheel and your left hand is to the left of the wheel.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:A wheel rotating on an axle, with a horizontal angular velocity (left). If you try to tilt the axle as shown in the right panel, changing the angular momentum of the wheel, you will also need to exert a torque in the vertical direction (shown at the bottom right).\n\nWe define a coordinate system as shown so that the wheel is spinning as shown in the left panel, with angular velocity (and angular momentum) in the positive x direction (the top of the wheel is coming towards you).\n\nYou then try to lift your right hand while lowering your left hand in order to tilt the rotation axis, as shown in the right panel. In doing so, you change the direction of the angular momentum (and angular velocity) of the wheel such that the angular momentum, \\vec L', now has a vertical component, \\Delta \\vec L, as shown. The torque that is required in order to change the angular momentum is given by:\\vec \\tau = \\frac{d\\vec L}{dt} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta \\vec L}{\\Delta t}\n\nwhere \\Delta t is the time that it takes to change the axis of rotation. The torque required in order to change the axis of rotation is directed in the same direction as \\Delta \\vec L (the positive y direction). That is, you will not be able to simply tilt the axle as shown; if you want to tilt the axle, you will also need to push forward with you right hand and pull backwards with your left hand to exert the required torque (shown in the bottom right of the figure)! If you simply try to tilt the rotation axis, your right hand will be pushed towards you and your left hand away from you, as a reaction to the torque that would otherwise be required to tilt the axis!","type":"content","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#angular-momentum-of-an-object-or-system","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl3":"Conservation of angular momentum","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#conservation-of-angular-momentum","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl3":"Conservation of angular momentum","lvl2":"Angular momentum"},"content":"In the previous section, we saw that the net external torque that is exerted on an object (or system) is equal to the rate of change of its angular momentum:\\frac{d\\vec L}{dt} = \\vec \\tau^{ext}\n\nwhere the angular momentum and torque are measured about the same axis or point of rotation, fixed in an inertial frame of reference.\n\nThe total angular momentum of a system about a point of rotation is conserved (i.e. does not change with time) if there is no net external torque exerted on the system about that point. If one makes the system large enough, then all of the torques can be taken to be internal, and the angular momentum of the system is conserved. The angular momentum of the Universe about a fixed point is thus conserved.\n\nConservation of angular momentum is another conservation law that we derived from Newton’s Second Law. In the modern formulation of physics, we understand that the conservation of angular momentum is associated with rotational symmetry of Newton’s Second Law; it does not matter from which “angle” we model a system, we can always use Newton’s Second Law. Similarly, conservation of linear momentum is associated with translational symmetry and conservation of energy is associated with the fact that Newton’s Second Law does not change with time. Angular momentum is fundamentally different than linear momentum and energy, and is conserved under different conditions. The angular momentum of a system about a given axis/point is conserved if there is no net torque on the system about that axis/point.\n\nExample 11.5\n\nDuring a spin, a figure skater brings his arms close to his body and increases his angular velocity from \\omega_1 to \\omega_2. By what fraction did his moment of inertia decrease in doing so?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can consider the rotation axis to be vertical through the centre of the skater. When the figure skater is spinning, there is no net external torque on him. Thus, his angular momentum is conserved as he bring his arms in. As he bring his arms in, his moment of inertia decreases, since he is bringing the mass of his arms closer to the axis of rotation. If I_1 and I_2 are the moments of inertia of the skater before and after brining his arms in, respectively, we can write the angular momentum about his axis of rotation as:L_1 &= I_1\\omega_1\\\\\nL_2 &= I_2\\omega_2\n\nSince there is no external torque on the skater, the angular momentum is the same before and after he changes his moment of inertia:L_1 &= L_2\\\\\nI_1\\omega_1 &= I_2\\omega_2\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{I_1}{I_2} &= \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}\n\nDiscussion: A spinning figure skater is a good example of the conservation of angular momentum. By changing their shape, they can change their moment of inertia and thus their angular velocity.\n\nExample 11.6\n\nShow that Kepler’s Second Law is equivalent to a statement about conservation of the angular momentum of a planet orbiting the Sun.\n\nSolution\n\nKepler’s Second Law states that in a period of time \\Delta t, the area, \\Delta A, that is swept out by a planet is constant, regardless of where it is along its orbit. In other words:\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta t} = \\text{constant}\n\nFigure 12 shows a planet in an elliptical orbit around the sun.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:The area swept out by a planet in a period of time dt.\n\nAt some point in time, the planet has a velocity vector \\vec v and position vector \\vec r relative to the Sun. In a small period of time dt, the planet will move along a short distance vdt, which we can take as a straight line if dt is small enough. Let ϕ be the angle between the velocity and position vectors when these are tail to tail, as illustrated.\n\nThe small amount of area, dA, swept out by the planet in a period of time dt, is given by the area of the right angle triangle with height r and base vdt\\sin\\phi:dA = \\frac{1}{2} r vdt\\sin\\phi\n\nThe rate at which the area is swept out is thus:\\frac{dA}{dt} =  \\frac{1}{2} r v\\sin\\phi\n\nConsider now the magnitude of the planet’s angular momentum about the Sun:L = rp\\sin\\phi = rmv\\sin\\phi\n\nwhere the mass of the planet is m. The rate at which the planet sweeps out the area can be written in terms of the angular momentum of the planet:\\frac{dA}{dt} &=  \\frac{1}{2} r v\\sin\\phi = \\frac{L}{2m}\n\nThe only force exerted on the planet is the gravitational force from the Sun. That force is always anti-parallel to the vector \\vec r from the Sun to the planet, and cannot result in a torque on the planet about the Sun. Thus, the angular momentum of the planet about the Sun must be conserved, and L is constant. In turn, this means that the rate at which area is swept out by the planet, which is proportional to L, is also constant. Thus, Kepler’s Second Law is equivalent to saying that the angular momentum of a planet relative to the Sun is constant.","type":"content","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#conservation-of-angular-momentum","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#summary","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 11 - Rotational energy and momentum","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"If an object is rotating with angular speed, ω, about an axis that is fixed in an inertial frame of reference, the rotational kinetic energy of that object is given by:K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of that object about the axis of rotation.\n\nThe net work done by the net torque exerted on an object about a fixed axis or rotation in an inertial frame of reference is equal to object’s change in rotational kinetic energy:W = \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2}\\vec \\tau^{net}\\cdot d\\vec \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega_2^2 -\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega_1^2\n\nIf a torque, \\vec \\tau, about a stationary axis is exerted on an object that is rotating with a constant angular velocity, \\vec \\omega, about that axis, then the torque does work at a rate:P = \\vec \\tau \\cdot \\vec \\omega\n\nIf an object of mass, M, is rotating about an axis through its centre of mass, and the centre of mass of is moving with speed, v_{CM}, relative to an inertial frame of reference, then the total kinetic energy of the object is given by:K_{tot} = K_{rot} + K_{trans} = \\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\\omega^2+ \\frac{1}{2}Mv_{CM}^2\n\nwhere, ω, is the angular speed of the object about the centre of mass, and, I_{CM}, is the moment of inertia of the object about the centre of mass. The two terms in the kinetic energy come from the rotation about the centre of mass (K_{rot}), and the translational motion of the centre of mass (K_{trans}).\n\nAn object is said to be rolling without slipping on a surface if the point on the object that is in contact with the surface is instantaneously at rest relative to the surface. We can model an object that is rolling without slipping by superimposing rotational motion about the centre of mass with translational motion of the centre of mass. The angular speed, ω, and the angular acceleration, α, of the object about an axis through its centre of mass are related to the speed, v_{CM}, and linear acceleration, a_{CM}, of the centre of mass, respectively:v_{CM} &= \\omega R\\\\\na_{CM} &= \\alpha R\n\nThese conditions are equivalent to stating that the object is rolling without slipping.\n\nWhen an object is rolling without slipping, we can also model its motion as if it were instantaneously rotating about an axis that goes through the point of contact between the object and the ground (the instantaneous axis of rotation). The angular speed (and acceleration) about the instantaneous axis of rotation are the same as they are when the object is modelled as rotating about its (moving) centre of mass.\n\nAn object can only be rolling without slipping if there is a force of static friction exerted by the surface on the object. Without this force, the object would slip along the surface.\n\nWe can define the angular momentum of a particle, \\vec L, about a point in an inertial frame of reference as:\\vec L = \\vec r \\times \\vec p\n\nwhere, \\vec r, is the vector from the point to the particle, and, \\vec p, is the linear momentum of the particle.

Before the collision, only the projectile has angular momentum about the axis of rotation, so the magnitude of the angular momentum before the collision is:L = rp\\sin\\phi\n\nwhere ϕ is the angle between the particle’s momentum, \\vec p=m\\vec v, and a vector, \\vec r, from the axis of rotation to the particle. We can calculate the particle’s angular momentum just before the collision, so that \\vec r is the vector from the centre of the circle to the point where the particle collides (with magnitude R, and perpendicular to \\vec v). The initial angular momentum of the system is thus:L=rp=Rmv\n\nAfter the collision, the projectile is embedded in the disk. The resulting object has a moment of inertia given by:I = I_{disk}+ I_{particle} = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2+mR^2\n\nAfter the collision, the angular momentum of the disk with the embedded projectile is given by:L'=I\\omega = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)R^2\\omega\n\nUsing conservation of angular momentum, the angular velocity of the disk after the collision is:L &= L'\\\\\nRmv &= \\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)R^2\\omega\\\\\n\\therefore \\omega &= \\frac{mv}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)R}\n\nWe do not expect that mechanical energy is conserved during the collision, since the projectile embeds itself, which must cost energy. The mechanical energy before the collision is given by the kinetic energy of the projectile:E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\nAfter the collision, the kinetic energy is the rotational kinetic energy of the disk with embedded projectile about the axis of rotation:E' &= \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)R^2 \\left( \\frac{mv}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)R}\\right)^2\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m^2}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)} v^2\n\nWe can see that E' is less than E, by taking their ratio:\\frac{E'}{E} &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m^2}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)} v^2}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{m}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}M+m\\right)}<1\n\nand we confirm that mechanical energy is not conserved in the collision (and that energy was lost since one had to deform the projectile and disk).\n\nLinear momentum is clearly not conserved since the final linear momentum is zero, whereas before the collision, it is \\vec p=m\\vec v. The centre of mass of the disk+projectile system moves before the collision and not after. There must thus be a net external force that is exerted on the system. That force is exerted by the table onto the axle of disk, as the disk would otherwise recoil when hit with the projectile.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we used conservation of angular momentum to model a collision. The collision is inelastic, because the projectile embeds itself into the disk. The linear momentum is not conserved through the collision because the axle about which the disk rotates must exert a force on the disk to prevent it from recoiling.\n\nTechnically, the potential energy should be taken for the height of the centre of mass, which is a distance h_{CM}=h+R\\cos\\theta from the ground at the top of the incline, and a height h'_{CM}=R at the bottom of the incline. The net difference in height for the centre of mass is thus h_{CM}-h'_{CM} = h+R(1-\\cos\\theta). If we assume that h is much bigger than R, then this is negligible, otherwise, that is what we should use instead of h for the potential energy.\n\nThis is only exact in the limit of dt\\to 0, when the small area from the extra piece outside of the ellipse vanishes.\n\nTechnically, if the point is the centre of mass, then this is valid even in an accelerating frame of reference.\n\nThis corresponds to the component of velocity perpendicular to \\vec r.\n\nThis corresponds to the component of acceleration perpendicular to \\vec r.}","type":"content","url":"/angularmomentumrolling#solutions","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 12 - Simple harmonic motion"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/simpleharmonicmotion","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 12 - Simple harmonic motion"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/simpleharmonicmotion","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 12 - Simple harmonic motion","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/simpleharmonicmotion#chapter-simpleharmonicmotion","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 12 - Simple harmonic motion","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"In this chapter, we look at oscillating systems that undergo “simple harmonic motion”, such as the motion of a mass attached to a spring.

You may be wondering why we can’t do the same thing in order to find x(t) for the mass-spring system. The difference is that, before, the acceleration was a function of time. Here, the acceleration is a function of x. This means that we have to use a different method to solve for x(t), which is why we are making these “guesses” to solve a differential equation.\n\nWe still need to identify what the constants A and ϕ have to do with the motion of the mass. The constant A is the maximal value that x(t) can take (when the cosine is equal to 1). This corresponds to the amplitude of the motion of the mass, which we already had labelled, A. The constant, ϕ, is called the “phase” and depends on when we choose t=0 to be. Suppose that we define time t=0 to be when the mass is at x=A; in that case:x(t=0) &= A\\\\\nA \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) &= A\\\\\nA \\cos(\\omega (0) + \\phi) &= A\\\\\n\\cos(\\phi) &= 1\\\\\n\\therefore \\phi = 0\n\nIf we define t=0 to be when the mass is at x=A, then the phase, ϕ, is zero. In general, the value of ϕ can take any value between -\\pi and +\\pi and, physically, corresponds to our choice of when t=0 (i.e. the position of the mass when we choose t=0).\n\nSince we have determined the position as a function of time for the mass, its velocity and acceleration as a function of time are easily found by taking the corresponding time derivatives:x(t) &= A \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\\\\\nv(t) &= \\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\\\\\na(t)&= \\frac{d}{dt}v(t) = -A\\omega^2\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat is the value of ϕ if we choose t=0 to be when the mass is at x=0 and moving in the positive x direction?\n\nπ\n\n-\\pi\n\n\\pi/2\n\n-\\pi/2\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe position of the mass is described by a sinusoidal function of time; we call this type of motion “simple harmonic motion”.

In this diagram, I have taken snapshots of the ball’s motion at regular time intervals as the ball moves from Position 1 to Position 5. Since the speed is constant, the balls are evenly spaced out around the circle. At the bottom of the figure, you can see what it would look like if we only considered the motion in the x direction (this is the projection of the motion onto the x axis). You could also think of this as what the motion would look like if you looked up at the circle from below. As you can see, this projection looks a lot like the motion of a mass on a spring. The motion of the ball is constrained between -A and +A (the turning points), and the velocity of the ball, in the x direction, will be highest when x=0.

We choose the origin of a one-dimensional vertical coordinate system (y axis) to be located at the rest length of the spring (left panel of \n\nFigure 5). When a mass m is attached to the spring, the spring will extend  and the end of the spring will move to a new equilibrium position, y_0, given by the condition that the net force on the mass m is zero. The only forces exerted on the mass are the force from the spring and its weight. The condition for the equilibrium is thus:\\sum F_y = F_g - F(y_0) &=0\\\\\n mg - ky_0 &= 0 \\\\\n \\therefore mg &= ky_0\n\nNow, consider the forces on the mass at some position y when the spring is extended downwards relative to the equilibrium position (right panel of \n\nFigure 5). Newton’s Second Law at that position can be written as:\\sum F_y = mg - ky &= ma\\\\\n\\therefore m \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}& = mg - ky\n\nNote that the net force on the mass will always be in the direction so as to “restore” the position of the mass back to the equilibrium position, y_0.

A mass m is then attached to the two springs, and x_0 corresponds to the equilibrium position of the mass when the net force from the two springs is zero. We will assume that the length of the mass is negligible, so that the ends of both springs are also at position x_0 at equilibrium. You can see in the middle panel of \n\nFigure 6 that both springs are in extension when in the equilibrium position. It is possible to have an equilibrium where both springs are in compression, if both springs are long enough to extend past x_0 when they are at rest.\n\nIf we assume that both springs are in extension at equilibrium, as shown in the figure, then the condition for equilibrium is given by requiring that the sum of the forces on the mass is zero when the mass is located at x_0.

We can use the equilibrium condition (k_1x_1+k_2x_2 =(k_1+k_2)x_0) to re-write this equation:-(k_1+k_2)x  + k_1x_1 + k_2 x_2&= m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\\\\\n-(k_1+k_2)x  + (k_1+k_2)x_0&= m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\\\\\n\\therefore -(k_1+k_2) (x-x_0) &= m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\n\nLet us define k=k_1+k_2 as the “effective” spring constant from the two springs combined.

In this case, the mass will oscillate about the equilibrium position, x_0, with a an effective spring constant k=k_1+k_2. Combining the two springs in this way is thus equivalent to having a single spring, but with spring constant k=k_1+k_2.

Consider the simple pendulum that is constructed from a mass-less string of length, L, attached to a fixed point on one end and to a point mass m on the other, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 7.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A simple pendulum which oscillates in a vertical plane.\n\nThe pendulum can swing in the vertical plane, and we have shown our choice of coordinate system (the z axis, not shown, is out of the page). The only two forces on the mass are the tension from the string and its weight. We can describe the position of the mass by the angle, \\theta(t), that the string makes with the vertical. We can model the dynamics of the simple pendulum by considering the net torque and angular acceleration about the axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the plane of the page and that goes through the point on the string that is fixed.\n\nThe force of tension cannot create a torque on the mass about the axis of rotation, as it is anti-parallel to the vector from the point of rotation to the mass. The net torque is thus the torque from the force of gravity:\\vec\\tau^{net} &=\\vec \\tau_g \\\\\n&=\\vec r \\times \\vec F_g = (L\\sin\\theta \\hat x - L\\cos\\theta \\hat y) \\times (-mg\\hat y)\\\\\n&=-mgL\\sin\\theta \\hat z\n\nwhere L is the magnitude of the vector, \\vec r, from the axis of rotation to where the force of gravity is exerted.

For the position illustrated in \n\nFigure 7, the angular acceleration of the pendulum is in the negative z direction (into the page) and corresponds to a clockwise motion for the pendulum, as we would expect. The angular acceleration is the second time derivative of the angle, θ:\\alpha = \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}\n\nWe can thus re-write the equation that we obtained from the rotational dynamics version of Newton’s Second Law as:-g\\sin\\theta \\hat z&= L \\vec\\alpha\\\\\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} &= -\\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta\n\nwhere we only used the magnitudes in the second equation, since all of the angular quantities are in the z direction. This equation of motion for \\theta(t) almost looks like the equation for simple harmonic oscillation for the angle θ (except that we have \\sin\\theta instead of θ). However, consider the “the small angle approximation”\\footnote{Look up the Maclaurin/Taylor series for the sine function!} for the sine function:\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\n\nIf the oscillations of the pendulum are “small”, such that the small angle approximation is valid, then the equation of motion for the pendulum is:\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} &= -\\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta \\approx -\\frac{g}{L}\\theta \\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} &=-\\frac{g}{L}\\theta \\quad (\\text{for small }\\theta)\n\nand the angle that the pendulum makes with the vertical is described by the equation for simple harmonic oscillation with angular frequency:\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\n\nThe angle, θ, as a function of time is thus described by the function:\\theta(t) = \\theta_{max}\\cos(\\omega t +\\phi)\n\nwhere \\theta_{max} is the maximal amplitude of the oscillations and ϕ is a phase that depends on when we choose to define t=0.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nKaiden built a grandfather clock using a simple pendulum, but he found that the period was twice as large as as he wanted it to be.

We define the x axis so that the origin is 50 {\\rm cm} above the ground (the equilibrium position when no one is standing on the platform) and choose the positive direction to be downwards (\n\nFigure 12).\n\n\n\nFigure 12:The platform when no one is standing on it.\n\nEven though we do not know the mass of the platform, or the actual resting lengths of the spring, we do not need to know these, since we can model the platform with nobody on it as a single spring with spring constant k=k_1+k_2 and rest position x=0.\n\nWhen Ty is standing on the platform, the sum of the forces is given by his weight and the force from the “effective spring”:\\sum F=mg-(k_1+k_2)x\n\nwhere we noted that, when the platform moves down, both the top and bottom spring will exert a force upwards (\n\nFigure 13).\n\nAt equilibrium, the sum of the forces is equal to zero. We can use this to solve for the displacement at x_0:0&=mg-(k_1+k_2)x_0\\\\\n\\therefore x_0&=\\frac{mg}{k_1+k_2}=\\frac{(30 {\\rm kg})(9.8 {\\rm m/s^2})}{(2400 {\\rm Nm})+(3480 {\\rm Nm})}=0.05 {\\rm m}\n\nWe will confirm that this is a simple harmonic oscillator by showing that the system’s motion can be described by the equation:\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&=-\\omega^2x\n\nFor some position x below equilibrium, we can rewrite Newton’s second law as:ma&=mg-(k_1+k_2)x\\\\\nm\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&=mg-(k_1+k_2)x\n\nIn order to show that this is simple harmonic motion, we need to combine the right hand side of the equation into one term. We found earlier that mg=(k_1+k_2)x_0, which we can use here:m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&=(k_1+k_2)x_0-(k_1+k_2)x\\\\\n\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&=\\frac{(k_1+k_2)}{m}(x_0-x)\\\\\n\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&=-\\frac{(k_1+k_2)}{m}(x-x_0)\\\\\n\nWe now define an x' axis such that x'=x-x_0. This means that the origin of the x' axis is at the new equilibrium position:\n\n\n\nFigure 13:The forces acting on the platform and our new coordinate system.\n\nWe can now rewrite our expression using the x' axis:\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&=-\\frac{(k_1+k_2)}{m}x'\n\nThis equation tells us that this is simple harmonic motion about the new equilibrium position, where \\omega=\\sqrt{(k_1+k_2)/m}. We know that the lowest point that the platform reaches is 35 {\\rm cm} above the ground, which, on our x' axis, corresponds to x'=10 {\\rm cm} (\n\nFigure 13). Thus, the amplitude of the oscillation is A=0.1 {\\rm m}. Because this is simple harmonic motion, we know that the position of the platform can be described by the following function:x'(t)&= A \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)\n\nWe set t=0 to be when the platform is at its lowest point (x'=A). The value of ϕ is thus:x'(0)&= A \\cos(\\omega (0) + \\phi)\\\\\nA&= A \\cos(\\phi)\\\\\n1&=\\cos(\\phi)\\\\\n\\therefore \\phi&=0\n\nThe velocity is given by:v(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) &= -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\\\\\n&=-A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)\n\nThe speed will be maximized when \\sin(\\omega t)=1\\quad \\textrm{or} -1 .

The only force that creates a torque on the masses is the restoring force from the twisting of the wire. The rotational dynamics version of Newton’s Second Law relates this torque to the angular acceleration, α of the rod:I\\alpha=-\\kappa\\theta\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the rod. Rewriting α more explicitly as the second time derivative of the angle, we get:I\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}&=-\\kappa\\theta\\\\\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}&=-\\frac{\\kappa}{I}\\theta\\\\\n\nBy inspection, we can see that the torsional pendulum is a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\omega=\\sqrt{\\kappa/I}. The period of the motion is therefore:T&=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\\\\nT&=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{\\kappa}}\n\nWe can rearrange this expression to get κ:T^2&=\\frac{4\\pi^2I}{\\kappa}\\\\\n\\kappa&=\\frac{4\\pi^2I}{T^2}\n\nThe moment of inertia for one of the masses is m(L/2)^2, where L/2 is the distance from the mass to the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia for the two masses attached to the mass-less rod is:I&=2m\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{mL^2}{2}\\\\\n\nPutting this into our expression for κ:\\kappa=\\frac{2\\pi^2mL^2}{T^2}\n\nb. The two forces that provide torques for the small spheres are gravity and the force exerted by the twisting wire. Each of the small spheres will experience a force due to gravity from the nearest large sphere. At equilibrium, the force due to gravity on one of the small spheres is therefore:F_g=\\frac{GMm}{d^2}\n\nAssuming that, at equilibrium, the force vector is perpendicular to the rod, the torque from one of the large spheres is just the force multiplied by the distance to the axis of rotation. Since there are two large spheres, each of which creates a torque on the pendulum, the total torque due to gravity is:\\tau_g&=2F_g\\frac{L}{2}\\\\\n&=F_gL\\\\\n&=\\frac{GMm}{d^2}L\n\n(Note that \\tau g is the torque due to gravity at equilibrium only). We can use Newton’s second law for the pendulum to find an expression for G. At equilibrium, the net torque is equal to zero, and the angle of deflection is β:\\tau_{net}&=\\tau_{wire}-\\tau_g\\\\\n0&=\\tau_{wire}-\\tau_g\\\\\n\\tau_g&=\\tau_{wire}\\\\\n\\frac{GMm}{d^2}L&=\\kappa\\beta\\\\\n\\therefore G&=\\frac{\\kappa\\beta d^2}{LMm}\n\nUsing our expression for κ found in part a), this becomes:G=\\frac{2\\pi^2L\\beta d^2}{MT^2}\n\nAs long as there is no friction to reduce the mechanical energy of the mass.\n\nThe argument to the cosine function is in radians, since the angular frequency is usually defined in radians per second. The value of ϕ is constrained to be within that range, since the cosine function is periodic with a period 2\\pi.","type":"content","url":"/simpleharmonicmotion#solutions","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/waves","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/waves","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/waves#chapter-waves","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"In this chapter we introduce the tools to describe waves.

Consider the waves made by fans at a soccer game, as in \n\nFigure 2.\nThe fans can be thought of as the medium through which the wave propagates. The elements of the medium may oscillate about an equilibrium position (the fans move a short distance up and down), but they do not travel with the wave (the fans do not move horizontally with the wave).\n\n\n\nFigure 2:A transverse wave made by soccer fans moving up and down.\n\nConsider the ripples (waves) made by a rock dropped in a pond (\n\nFigure 3). The ripples travel outwards from where the rock was dropped, but the water itself does not move outwards. The individual water molecules will move in small circles about an equilibrium position, but they do not move along with the waves.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:A transverse wave travelling through water. The left panel shows the view from above as ripples move outwards. The right panel shows the motion of an individual water molecule as the wave is viewed from the side.\n\nWe can distinguish between two classes of waves, based on the motion of the medium through which it propagates. With transverse waves, the elements of the medium oscillate back and forth in a direction perpendicular to the motion of the wave. For example, if you attach a horizontal rope to a wall and move the other end up and down (\n\nFigure 4), you can create a disturbance (a wave) that travels horizontally along the rope. The parts of the rope do not move horizontally; they only move up and down, about some equilibrium position.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A transverse wave travelling through a rope. The wave is created by moving one end of the rope up and down.\n\nWith longitudinal waves, the elements of the medium oscillate back and forth in the same direction as the motion of the wave. If you clap your hands, you will create a pressure disturbance in the air that will propagate; this is what we call sound (a sound wave). The air molecules oscillate about an equilibrium position in the same direction as the wave propagates, but they do not move with the wave.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:A longitudinal sound wave travelling through the air. The air molecules move back and forth in the same direction as the wave, but they oscillate about an equilibrium position instead of moving with the wave.\n\nFurthermore, we can distinguish between “travelling waves”, in which a disturbance propagates through a medium, and “standing waves”, which do not transport energy through the medium (for example, a vibrating string on a violin).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nAre the waves propagating through a slinky when you compress and elongate it (\n\nFigure 6) transverse or longitudinal?\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A wave travelling through a slinky. The wave is created when you compress or elongate the slinky.\n\nTransverse\n\nLongitudinal\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nPhysically, a wave can only propagate through a medium if the medium can be deformed. When a particle in the medium is disturbed from its equilibrium position, it will experience a restoring force that acts to bring it back to its equilibrium position. Often, if the displacement of the particle from the equilibrium is small, the magnitude of that force is proportional to the displacement. Thus, as we will see, we can model the propagation of waves by treating the particles in the medium as simple harmonic oscillators.\n\nA source of energy is required in order to deform the medium and generate a wave. For example, that source of energy could be a speaker creating sound waves by pushing a membrane back and forth; speakers require energy, and are often rated by the electrical power that they convert into sound waves (e.g. a 50 {\\rm W} speaker consumes 50 {\\rm W} of electrical power to produce sound).\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A speaker creating sound waves.

As we will see, more complicated waves can always be described as if they are the combination of multiple sine waves. We can use several quantities to describe a travelling wave, which are illustrated in \n\nFigure 8:\n\nThe wavelength, λ, is the distance between two  successive maxima (“peaks”) or minima (“troughs”) in the wave.\n\nThe amplitude, A, is the maximal distance that a particle in the medium is displaced from its equilibrium position.\n\nThe velocity, \\vec v, is the velocity with which the disturbance propagates through the medium.\n\nThe period, T, is the time it takes for two successive maxima (or minima) to pass through the same point in the medium.\n\nThe frequency, f, is the inverse of the period (f=1/T).\n\n\n\nFigure 8:Wavelength, velocity, and amplitude for a transverse wave on a rope.\n\nThe wavelength, speed, and period of the wave are related, since the amount of time that it takes for two successive maxima of the wave to pass through a given point will depend on the speed of the wave and the distance between maxima, λ. Since it takes a time, T, for two maxima a distance λ apart to pass through a given point in the medium, the speed of the wave is given by:\\boxed{v = \\frac{\\lambda}{T}=\\lambda f}\n\nThus, of the three quantities (speed, period/frequency, and wavelength), only two are independent, as the third quantity must depend on the value of the other two. The speed of a wave depends on the properties of the medium through which the wave propagates and not on the mechanism that is generating the wave. For example, the speed of sound waves depends on the pressure, density, and temperature of the air through which they propagate, and not on what is making the sound. When a mechanism generates a wave, that mechanism usually determines the frequency of the wave (e.g. frequency with which the hand in \n\nFigure 8 moves up and down), the speed is determined by the medium, and the wavelength can be determined from \n\n(1).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat can you say about the sound emitted by a cello versus that emitted by a violin?}\n\nThe sound from the violin has a higher frequency.\n\nThe sound from the cello has a longer wavelength.\n\nThe sound from both instruments propagates at the same speed.\n\nAll of the above.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/waves#description-of-a-wave","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Mathematical description of a wave"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/waves#mathematical-description-of-a-wave","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Mathematical description of a wave"},"content":"In order to describe the motion of a wave through a medium, we can describe the motion of the individual particles of the medium as the wave passes through. Specifically, we describe the position of each particle using its displacement, D, from its equilibrium position. Consider our rope example in which a sine wave is propagating through a medium (the rope) in the positive x direction, as shown in \n\nFigure 9\n\n\n\nFigure 9:The displacement (D) of points at different positions (x) on a rope as a sine wave passes through.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Displacement as a function of position for particles in a medium as a wave passes through. The dotted line shows the dipsplacement as a function of time {\\rm 1/s} after the solid line, and corresponds to a wave travelling towards the right.\n\nThe displacement, D, of each point at position, x, in the medium is shown on the vertical axis of \n\nFigure 10. The solid black line corresponds to a snapshot of the wave at time t=0. The wave has an amplitude, A=5 {\\rm m}, a velocity, v=1 {\\rm m/s}, and a wavelength, \\lambda=4 {\\rm m}. The dotted line corresponds to a snapshot of the wave one second later, at t=1 {\\rm s}, when the wave has moved to the right by a distance vt=1 {\\rm m}.\n\nIt is important to note that \n\nFigure 10 is not restricted to describing transverse waves, even if the illustration suggests that the particles’ displacements (vertical axis) are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave (horizontal). The quantity, D, that is plotted on the vertical axis corresponds to the displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position. That displacement could correspond to the longitudinal displacement of a particle in a longitudinal wave.\n\nAt time t=0 (solid line), the displacement of each point in the medium, D(x, t=0), as a function of their distance from the origin, x, can be described by a sine function:D(x,t=0) = A\\sin\\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}x \\right)\n\nThis corresponds to the displacement being 0 at the origin and at any position, x, that is a multiple of the wavelength, λ.\n\nIf the wave moves with velocity v in the positive x direction, then at time t, the sine function in \n\nFigure 10 will have shifted to the right by an amount vt (dotted line). The displacement of a point located at position x at time t will be the same as the displacement of the point at position x-vt at time t=0. For example, in \n\nFigure 10 the displacement of the point x=2 {\\rm m} at time t=1 {\\rm s} is the same as the displacement of the point at position x-vt=1 {\\rm m} at t=0.\n\nWe can state this condition as:D(x,t) = D(x-vt, t=0)\n\nThat is, at some time t, the displacement of a point at position x is found by finding the position of the point at x-vt at t=0. We already have an equation to find the displacement of a point at t=0.  Using the above condition, we can modify \n\n to write a function for the displacement of a point at position x at time t:D(x,t) = A\\sin\\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}(x-vt) \\right)\n\nNoting that v/\\lambda= 1/T, we can write this as:D(x,t) = A\\sin\\left( \\frac{2\\pi x}{\\lambda}- \\frac{2\\pi t}{T} \\right)\n\nIn the above derivation, we assumed that at time t=0, the displacement at x=0 was D(x=0, t=0)=0. In general, the displacement could have any value at x=0 and t=0, so we can allow the wave to shift left or right by including a phase, ϕ, which can be determined from the displacement at x=0 and t=0:\\boxed{D(x,t) = A\\sin\\left( \\frac{2\\pi x}{\\lambda}- \\frac{2\\pi t}{T} + \\phi \\right)}\n\nwhere \\phi=0 corresponds to the displacement being zero at x=0 and t=0.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat is the value of the phase ϕ if the displacement of the point at x=0 is D=A/2 at time t=0?}\n\n\\pi/6.\n\n\\pi/4.\n\n\\pi/3.\n\n\\pi/2.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe equation above is written in terms of the wavelength, λ, and period, T, of the wave.

For the harmonic oscillator, the properties of the system (e.g. mass and spring constant) determine the angular frequency, ω. For a wave, the properties of the medium determine the speed of the wave, v.\n\nWe use partial derivatives in the wave equation instead of total derivatives because D(x,t) is multi-variate.

A wave is generally considered to be a regular series of alternating upwards and downwards pulses propagating down the rope. Modelling the propagation of a pulse is thus equivalent to modelling the propagation of a wave. \n\nFigure 11 shows how one can generate a pulse in a taught horizontal rope by raising (and then lowering) one end of the rope.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:(Left:) Pulling upwards and then downwards on a horizontal rope causes a pulse to form and propagate. After a short period of time, a pulse is seen propagating down the rope (right).\n\nWe can model the propagation speed of the pulse by considering the speed, v, of point B that is shown in the left panel of \n\nFigure 11. Note that point B is not a particle of the rope, and is, instead, the location of the “front” of the disturbance that the pulse causes on the rope. We model the rope as being under a horizontal force of tension, \\vec F_T, and the pulse is started by exerting a vertical force, \\vec F, to move the end (point A) of the rope upwards with a speed, v'. Thus, by pulling upwards on the rope with a force, \\vec F, at a speed v', we can start a disturbance in the rope that will propagate with speed v.\n\nIn a short amount of time, t, the point A on the rope will have moved up by a distance v't, whereas point B will have moved to the right by a distance vt. If t is small enough, we can consider the points A, B, and C to form the corners of a triangle. That triangle is similar to the triangle that is made by vectorially summing the applied force \\vec F and the tension \\vec F_T, as shown in the top left of \n\nFigure 11. In this case, we mean the geometry term “similar”, which describes two triangles which have the same angles.

By Newton’s Third Law, the wall will then exert a downwards force on the rope, \\vec F_{from\\; wall}. The downwards force exerted on the rope will cause a downwards pulse to form, and the reflected pulse will be inverted compared to the initial pulse that arrived at the wall.\n\nNow, consider the case when the end of the rope has a ring attached to it, so that it can slide freely up and down a post, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 13.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:When the end of the rope is free, the reflected pulse will be upright.\n\nIn this case, the end of the rope will move up as the pulse arrives, which will then create a reflected pulse that is in the same orientation as the incoming pulse.\n\nFinally, consider a pulse that propagates down a rope of mass per unit length \\mu_1 that is tied to a second rope with mass per unit length \\mu_2, which have the same tension. When the pulse arrives at the interface between the two media (the two ropes), part of the pulse will be reflected back, and part will be transmitted into the second medium (\n\nFigure 14).\n\n\n\nFigure 14:A pulse can be both reflected and transmitted as it changes medium. Left panel: The pulse is transmitted from a lighter rope to a heavier rope. Right panel: The pulse is transmitted from a heavier rope to a lighter rope\n\nBy considering the boundary conditions, one can derive the coefficient of reflection, R (see \n\nProblems for the derivation).

Thus, the only forces exerted on the mass element are those from the tension in the rope, pulling on the mass element from each side, with forces, \\vec F_{T1} and \\vec F_{T2}. In general, the forces from tension on either side of the mass element will have different directions and make different angles, θ, with the horizontal, although their magnitude is the same. Let D(x,t) be the vertical displacement of the mass element located at position x. We can write the y (vertical) component of Newton’s Second Law for the mass element, dm, as:\\sum F_y = F_{T2y} - F_{T1y} &= (dm)a_y\\\\\nF_T\\sin\\theta_2 - F_T\\sin\\theta_1 &= dm \\frac{\\partial ^2D}{\\partial t^2}\\\\\nF_T(\\sin\\theta_2 - \\sin\\theta_1) &= dm \\frac{\\partial ^2D}{\\partial t^2}\n\nwhere we used the fact that the force of tension has a magnitude, F_T, on either side of the mass element, and that the acceleration of the mass in the vertical direction is the second time-derivative of D(x,t), since for a transverse wave, this corresponds to the y position of a particle. We now make the small angle approximation:\\sin\\theta\\approx \\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial x}\n\nin which the sine of the angle is approximately equal to the tangent of the angle, which is equal to the slope of the rope.

The sum (integral) of the energy of the oscillators over one wavelength can thus be written as:E_\\lambda = \\int_0^\\lambda \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\mu A^2 dx =  \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\mu A^2 \\lambda\n\nThe energy stored in one wavelength is not a very useful property of a wave, since the total energy in the wave depends on the length of the wave. We can describe the rate at which energy is transmitted by the wave (its power), since we know how long, T, it will take the wave to travel one wavelength, and we just determined how much energy is stored in one wavelength. The average power with which energy is transported by a wave is given by:P = \\frac{E_\\lambda}{T} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\mu A^2 \\lambda}{T}=\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\mu A^2 v\n\nwhere T is the period of the wave, and v=\\lambda/T is the speed of the wave. The power transmitted by a wave on a rope is thus given by:\\boxed{P=\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\mu A^2 v}\n\nWe can see that the power transmitted by a wave goes as the amplitude, A, of the wave squared. It thus takes four times more energy to double the amplitude of waves that are sent down a rope.","type":"content","url":"/waves#energy-transported-in-a-one-dimensional-wave","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl3":"Energy transported in a spherical, three-dimensional, wave","lvl2":"Energy transported by a wave"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/waves#energy-transported-in-a-spherical-three-dimensional-wave","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl3":"Energy transported in a spherical, three-dimensional, wave","lvl2":"Energy transported by a wave"},"content":"In this section, we show how to model the rate at which energy is transported in spherical three-dimensional waves, such as the sound waves that are generated when you clap your hands. A spherical sound wave is a pressure disturbance in the air that propagates spherically outwards from a point of emission. We can think of thin spherical shells containing air that expand and contract about their equilibrium position as the wave moves through the shells. The motion of each shell is similar to that of a simple harmonic oscillator of mass dm, where dm is the mass of air in the oscillating shell.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:Left: We divide the air into thin spherical shells. Here we represent three shells (the black circles). Center: When you clap, the innermost shell is given energy and expands. Right: Energy is transferred to the next shell, which expands as the first shell contracts. This is how the wave propagates outwards. When the shells are closer together, the air molecules are closer together and exert a pressure that tries to expand the shell.\n\nConsider a shell at a radial position, r, from the source, with thickness dr, and mass dm:\n\n\n\nFigure 19:A spherical shell at radial position r with thickness dr\n\nIf the medium has a density, ρ, then the mass of the shell is given by:dm = \\rho dV = \\rho 4\\pi r^2 dr\n\nwhere dV = 4\\pi r^2 dr is the volume of the shell. Again, if we model each shell as a simple harmonic oscillator with mass dm, then the energy, dE, stored in that oscillating shell is given by:dE = \\frac{1}{2}k_s A^2 =  \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 dm A^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 A^2 \\rho 4\\pi r^2 dr=2\\pi\\rho  \\omega^2 A^2  r^2 dr\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency of the wave, and A is the amplitude of the wave. We expressed the effective spring constant, k_s, in terms of the angular frequency of the simple harmonic oscillator and its mass, as we did in the previous section. It now makes less sense to determine the energy that is stored in one wavelength of the wave because the energy, dE, stored in one shell depends on the location, r, of that shell. This was not the case for a one-dimensional wave, where the energy stored in one oscillator did not depend on the position of that oscillator.\n\nThe rate at which energy is transported by the wave is given by:P = \\frac{dE}{dt}\n\nWe can use the Chain Rule to change this into a derivative over r:P = \\frac{dE}{dr}\\frac{dr}{dt}=\\frac{dE}{dr}v\n\nwhere \\frac{dr}{dt}=v is the speed of the wave (the rate of change of the radius of a shell). The power transmitted by the spherical wave is thus given by:P &=\\frac{dE}{dr}v =2\\pi\\rho  \\omega^2 A^2  r^2 v\n\nwhere the power appears to depends on how far you are from the source (r).\n\nSuppose that you have a 50 {\\rm W} speaker emitting sound; each radial shell emanating from the speaker must transport energy at a rate of 50 {\\rm W}. This is simply a statement that the energy radiated by the speaker has to move from one shell to the next and be conserved. Since the power transported by a shell appears to depend on the radius of the shell, if the power transmitted by each shell is the same, then the amplitude of the wave in each shell must decrease, so that the power does not actually depend on the radius of the shell. In particular, for a spherical wave, the amplitude will decrease as a function of distance from the source:P& = \\text{constant}\\\\\n\\therefore A&=\\frac{1}{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{2\\pi\\rho \\omega^2 v}}\n\nThis is very different from the propagation of a one-dimensional wave, in which the amplitude does not change with distance. In practice, if there are energy losses due to, say, friction, then the amplitude of a one-dimensional wave would also decrease with distance from the source, but this is a different effect.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nHere’s a slightly different way to think about why the amplitude of the wave decreases as you get further from the source. When a spherical wave travels outwards, energy is passed from one shell to the next. The outer shells are bigger than the inner shells, and so they will contain more particles. Because of conservation of energy, when the energy is transferred from one shell to the next, the total energy stays the same. In the outer shells, the energy must be shared between a greater number of particles, so each particle gets less energy, and therefore oscillates with a smaller amplitude than the particles in the previous shell did.\n\nTo remember this, imagine the shells in \n\nFigure 18 are circles of kids standing side by side. The innermost circle has 10 kids and the outermost circle has 100 kids. If you have 100 candies, and you give them to the kids in the innermost circle, each will get 10 so they will get really hyper and start jumping around a lot. If you instead give the 100 candies to the kids in the outermost circle, each will only get one. The kids will only get a little bit hyper and jump around less.\n\nThe “intensity of a wave”, I, is defined as the power per unit area that is transmitted by the wave. For a spherical wave front at radial position r, with area 4\\pi r^2, the intensity of the wave is defined as:I = \\frac{P}{4\\pi r^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho  \\omega^2 A^2 v\n\nUsually, the intensity of a wave is something that you can measure, as it corresponds to the power delivered into some measuring device with a known surface area. For example, we cannot directly measure the total power that is transported by the waves from an earthquake, as we would need an instrument that could encompass the entire resulting wave. Instead, we can measure the intensity of waves from the earthquake by measuring how much power is delivered into some instrument with a known surface area. By knowing our distance from the earthquake, we could then determine the total power output of the earthquake.\n\nThe intensity is a measure of how much energy is delivered per unit area by a wave and goes down as the square of the distance from the source (since A\\propto 1/r). If the source of the wave is an earthquake, then your house will have four times less damage than your friend’s, if your house is located only twice as far from the epicentre as your friend’s. You will cause four times less damage to your ears if you move only twice as far away from the stage at a rock concert.","type":"content","url":"/waves#energy-transported-in-a-spherical-three-dimensional-wave","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Superposition of waves and interference"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/waves#superposition-of-waves-and-interference","position":32},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Superposition of waves and interference"},"content":"In this section, we consider what happens when two (or more) different waves propagate in a medium and interfere with each other.

The waves are shown as the displacement as a function of position at a fixed instant in time.\n\nThe resulting wave is created by the “interference” of the three waves, and mathematically is simply a sum of the three individual waves at each position (and instant in time). The resulting wave in this example has a rather complicated shape, that is no longer described by a sine function. However, by the superposition principle, it is a valid solution to the wave equation.\n\nThe individual waves in the top three panels of \n\nFigure 20 all have an amplitude of 5 {\\rm m}. The resulting wave, at some points (e.g. at x=2 {\\rm m}), has an amplitude that is larger than any of the individual waves; we say that, at those positions, the individual waves have “constructively interfered”. In other locations (e.g. at x=6 {\\rm m}), the resulting wave has a smaller amplitude than the individual waves, and we say that the individual waves have “destructively interfered”. The interference between waves can be observed easily on a water surface, for example by observing the constructive and destructive interference pattern of waves that originate from two pebbles being dropped at the same time a certain distance apart. Constructive interference between waves is also thought to be behind some reports of gigantic waves observed out at sea.\n\nIf two waves have the same wavelength and amplitude, it is possible for them to completely destructively interfere, resulting in no net wave. Similarly, they can also completely constructively interfere, resulting in a wave with a larger amplitude. Complete destructive and constructive interference are illustrated in the left and right panel of \n\nFigure 21, respectively.\n\n\n\nFigure 21:Destructive (left) and constructive (right) interference of waves.","type":"content","url":"/waves#superposition-of-waves-and-interference","position":33},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Standing waves"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/waves#standing-waves","position":34},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Standing waves"},"content":"As we saw in the last section, when waves have the same frequency, it is possible for them to interfere completely, either destructively or constructively. Waves of the same frequency that interfere can be generated by propagating waves along a string, as the reflected waves from the end of the string will have the same frequency as, and interfere with, the original waves. In general, the resulting wave will be quite complicated, but if you “choose” the frequency (or wavelength) of the generated waves precisely, then the waves will interfere and create a “standing wave”. The standing wave is named this way because it does not appear to propagate along the string. Instead, each point on the string will oscillate with an amplitude that depends on where the point is located along on the string. In contrast, for a travelling wave, all of the points oscillate with the same amplitude.\n\nThree standing waves of different frequencies (wavelengths) are illustrated in \n\nFigure 22.\n\n\n\nFigure 22:The first three standing waves on a string.\n\nThe solid line in each of the three panels corresponds to one particular snapshot of the standing wave at a particular instant in time. The dashed lines correspond to snapshots at different times. In particular, there is a time where the displacement of all points on the string is zero. Each point on the string vibrates with a different amplitude, which corresponds to the solid line (and the opposite dashed line). Certain points do not oscillate at all; these are called “nodes”. The points at the end of the string are always nodes. Certain points vibrate with a maximal amplitude; these are called “anti-nodes”.\n\nIn general, if you pluck a taught string (such as a guitar string), you will create a complicated wave, equivalent to many sine waves with different frequencies, that propagate outwards from the point where the string was plucked. Those sine waves will be reflected by the ends of the string and interfere with each other. Most of the waves will interfere in a complicated way and decay away. Those waves that have the correct frequency to create standing waves will persist on the string for a longer period of time. The string will eventually vibrate as a superposition of the fundamental frequency (the standing wave with one anti-node, also called the first harmonic), and the higher “harmonics” (those standing waves with more anti-nodes).\n\nThe wavelength of the fundamental standing wave for a string of length, L, is given by the condition:\\lambda = 2L\n\nIn general, the nth harmonic will have a wavelength of:\\boxed{\\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n}\\quad\\quad n=1,2,3,\\dots}\n\nThe corresponding frequency is give by:\\boxed{f_n =\\frac{nv}{2L}}\n\nwhere v=f\\lambda is the speed of the waves on the string.\n\nA standing wave is the result of two waves of the same frequency and amplitude travelling in opposite directions. Thus, there is no energy that is transmitted by a standing wave (e.g. through the nodes at the end of the string). Although we described standing waves for a string, these are not restricted to one dimensional waves. For example, the membrane of a drum can also support standing waves.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA standing wave (composed of two travelling waves) has a maximum amplitude A. What must the amplitude A_0 of each travelling wave be?\n\nA_0=1/4 A\n\nA_0=1/2 A\n\nA_0=A\n\nA_0=2A\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nIn general, most objects can be characterized by a harmonic (or “resonant”) frequency that corresponds to the standing waves that can exist in the object. If that object is, say, shaken, many waves will propagate through the object and cancel out, except those that have the resonant frequency. Relatively small vibrations, if at the correct frequency, can lead to large standing waves that can result in damage to the object.","type":"content","url":"/waves#standing-waves","position":35},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl3":"Mathematical description of a standing wave","lvl2":"Standing waves"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/waves#mathematical-description-of-a-standing-wave","position":36},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl3":"Mathematical description of a standing wave","lvl2":"Standing waves"},"content":"A standing wave is the result of two identical waves, travelling in opposite directions, interfering.

This makes sense when we remember that the standing wave is made of two travelling waves of amplitude A. As these waves move, there will be moments when they completely constructively interfere, which is when the amplitude of the standing wave is maximized. When they completely destructively interfere, the amplitude is zero.","type":"content","url":"/waves#mathematical-description-of-a-standing-wave","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/waves#summary","position":38},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 13 - Waves","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"A travelling wave is the propagation of a disturbance with a speed, v, through a medium.

The equation for a standing wave is:D(x,t)=2A\\sin(kx)cos(\\omega t)\n\nWe let the fixed end be at x=0. At the fixed end, the displacement is equal to zero. At the free end (x=L) the displacement is maximized. The first condition is always true. The second condition will be met when:\\sin(kL)&=1\\\\\n\\therefore kL&=\\pi/2,3\\pi/2,...\\\\\n\nThis condition can be expressed as:kL&=\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{2\\pi L}{\\lambda}&=\\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2}\\\\\n\\therefore \\lambda&=\\frac{4L}{2n-1}\n\nwhere, in the second line, we used k=2\\pi /\\lambda.

We found that the wavelength for the n^{th} wavelength is given by:\\lambda=\\frac{4L}{2n-1}\n\nWriting λ in terms of the velocity, v, and frequency, f, gives:\\frac{v}{f}&=\\frac{4L}{2n-1}\\\\\n\\therefore f&=\\frac{v(2n-1)}{4L}\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that, if we want to find the lowest frequency, we want n=1.

However, the value we found differs from the true value. Why might this be?\n\nSolution 13.2\n\na. We let the incident pulse move in the positive x direction (\n\nFigure 27), and set x=0 to be where the ropes connect.\n\n\n\nFigure 27:An incident pulse propagates through a rope connected to a another rope with a different linear mass density. When it reaches the boundary, part of the pulse is reflected and part is transmitted. Whether the reflected pulse is inverted or upright will depend on the reflection coefficient.\n\nThe incident pulse (denoted by i) is a travelling wave, moving in one dimension in the positive x direction. The incident pulse can thus be described by the function:D_I(x,t)=A_I\\cos(k_1x-\\omega t)\\\\\n\nWe will use the formulas k=2\\pi/\\lambda and \\omega=2\\pi f to rewrite this equation in the form D=(a(t\\pm x/v)). The frequency, f, of the wave will be the same in both ropes. The velocity of the wave, and therefore its wavelength, depends on the mass density of the rope. Since the incident wave travels through the first rope (\\mu_1), its velocity will be v_1 and its wavelength will be \\lambda_1. The incident wave can thus be described by:D_I&=A_I\\cos\\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_1}x-2\\pi ft\\right)\\\\\n&=A_I\\cos \\left( 2\\pi\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_1}x- ft\\right)\\right)\\\\\n&=A_I\\cos \\left( 2\\pi f\\left(\\frac{x}{v_1}- t\\right)\\right)\\\\\n&=A_I\\cos \\left( -2\\pi f\\left(t-\\frac{x}{v_1}\\right)\\right)\\\\\nD_I&=A_I\\cos \\left(2\\pi f\\left(t-\\frac{x}{v_1}\\right)\\right)\n\nwhere we used v=f\\lambda, and noted that \\cos(-x)=\\cos(x).\\\n\nThe transmitted wave (denoted by the subscript T) will also travel in the positive x direction, but its speed will be v_2, since it travels through the second rope:D_T&=A_T\\cos \\left( 2\\pi f\\left(t-\\frac{x}{v_2}\\right)\\right)\n\nThe reflected wave (denoted by R) will travel in the -x direction and at the same speed as the incident pulse.D_R&=A_R\\cos \\left( 2\\pi f\\left(t+\\frac{x}{v_1}\\right)\\right)\n\nb. We will consider the boundary conditions at the interface between the two ropes. One boundary condition is that the rope must be continuous. As a result, the vertical displacement on the -x side of the boundary must be the same as the vertical displacement on the +x side of the boundary at every instant:D_{-x}&=D_{+x}\\quad\\text{at $x=0$}\n\nThe amplitude on the +x side is equal to the amplitude of the transmitted pulse. For the -x side of the boundary, we have to take into account that the incident and reflected pulses will superimpose (when the front of the incident pulse reaches the boundary, it will be reflected and interfere with the end of the incident pulse). This boundary condition can thus be expressed as:A_I+A_R&=A_T\n\nThe slope of the rope must also be continuous at the boundary. Since the incident and reflected pulses superimpose, and the principle of superposition states that the net displacement is the sum of the displacement of these two waves, we can write:\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(D_I+D_R)\\Bigr|_{x=0}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}D_T\\Bigr|_{x=0}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}D_I\\Bigr|_{x=0}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}D_R\\Bigr|_{x=0}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}D_T\\Bigr|_{x=0}\n\nUsing our equations for the incident, transmitted, and reflected pulses found in part a), and taking the appropriate partial derivatives, this equation becomes:(A_I/v_1) \\sin \\left(2\\pi f\\left( t-\\frac{x}{v_1}\\right)\\right)\\Bigr|_{x=0}+(-A_R/v_1) \\sin \\left( 2\\pi f\\left( t+\\frac{x}{v_1}\\right)\\right)\\Bigr|_{x=0}&=\\\\(A_T/v_2) \\sin \\left( 2\\pi f\\left( t-\\frac{x}{v_2}\\right)\\right)\\Bigr|_{x=0}\n\nEvaluating at x=0 gives:(A_I/v_1) \\sin (2\\pi ft) +(-A_R/v_1) \\sin (2\\pi ft)&=(A_T/v_2) \\sin (2\\pi ft)\\\\\n\\frac{A_I}{v_1} -\\frac{A_R}{v_1}&=\\frac{A_T}{v_2}\n\nUsing our first condition, A_I+A_R=A_T, we get:\\frac{A_I}{v_1} -\\frac{A_R}{v_1}&=\\frac{A_I}{v_2}+\\frac{A_R}{v_2}\\\\\n\nNow, we can rearrange to find the reflection coefficient, R=A_R/A_I:A_I\\left( \\frac{v_2-v_1}{v_1v_2}\\right)&=A_R\\left( \\frac{v_2+v_1}{v_1v_2}\\right)\\\\\nR&=\\frac{v_2-v_1}{v_2+v_1}\n\nSince the velocities in the first and second rope are v_1=\\sqrt{F_T/\\mu_1} and v_2=\\sqrt{F_T/\\mu_2}, respectively, the reflection coefficient can be written as:R&=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{F_T}{\\mu_2}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{F_T}{\\mu_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{F_T}{\\mu_2}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{F_T}{\\mu_1}}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt{F_T}}{\\sqrt{F_T}}\\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_2}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_1}}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_1}}}\\\\\n\\therefore R&=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu_1}-\\sqrt{\\mu_2}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_1}+\\sqrt{\\mu_2}}\n\nas desired.\n\nWe do not use T for tension, so as to not confuse with the period of a wave.\n\nIf the medium has a linear restoring force or if the amplitude of the oscillations is small.\n\nWe use k_s for the spring constant, to distinguish it from k, the wave number.\n\nFourier’s Theorem states that any periodic function can be described as the linear combination of sine (or cosine) functions.

The SI unit for pressure is the Pascal ({\\rm Pa}). Pressure is related to the area, A, over which a force is exerted, and can be thought of as a measure of how concentrated that force is. For example, a force of 10 {\\rm N} exerted through a needle (a small area) will result in a much larger pressure than if that force was exerted by a flat hand (a larger area).Pressure is a useful concept for modelling fluids, as the pressure in a fluid can be used to model whether the fluid will move or not.\n\nWhen a force is exerted on a fluid, it creates pressure that we model as being everywhere in the fluid.\nFor each element in the fluid, the pressure from the surrounding fluid exerts an inwards force on the element from all directions (see \n\nFigure 2). In reaction, the element exerts an outwards force in all directions, and these forces act on neighbouring elements.\n\nThis is somewhat analogous to the tension that exists everywhere in a rope, where each element of the rope experiences forces from the neighbouring elements in rope that try to “pull it apart”. Pressure can be thought of as a “negative” tension, in that the material under pressure is experiencing forces trying to collapse the element onto itself, rather than trying to pull it apart. To create a tension in a rope, one would exert an outwards force on the rope (in order to stretch it), so that the rope exerts an inwards force in reaction. In order to create pressure in a fluid, one must exert an inwards force on the fluid, which then exerts an outwards force in reaction.\n\nIf we consider a small cubic volume of fluid, as depicted in the centre of \n\nFigure 2, that element of fluid will experience inwards forces in all directions from the pressure in the surrounding fluid, as illustrated by the arrows. If the forces from the pressure result in no net force on the fluid element, then we say that the fluid is in hydrostatic equilibrium, and the element of fluid will be at rest in an inertial frame of reference.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:A small element inside of a fluid with pressure will experience no net force from the pressure in the fluid, since the force associated with the pressure in the fluid is exerted in all directions.\n\nConsider, instead, an element of fluid that at the edge of a container for the fluid (e.g. a cup of water), as depicted in \n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:At the edge of a container, a small element of fluid will exert an outwards force on the container, and the container will exert an inwards force on the element of fluid.\n\nIn this case, there is no fluid on the right-hand side of the fluid element to exert a force towards the left. If the fluid element is in equilibrium, it must then be the container that exerts that force, \\vec F_{container}, on the fluid. By Newton’s Third Law, the element of fluid exerts an outwards force on the container. This is true at all points on the surface of container, which will all experience an outwards force from the pressure of the fluid. If the pressure is constant over a surface, the magnitude of the outwards force on the surface will be equal to the pressure of the fluid multiplied by the area of that surface.\n\nIf you place an empty sealed tin can under water, the water will exert a pressure on all of the surfaces of the tin can that leads to a net inwards force on all surfaces of the tin can. If the water pressure is high enough, the tin can will get crushed. If, on the other hand, the tin can is allowed to fill with water, it will not get crushed, as the water inside the tin can will have the same pressure as the water outside the tin can and will exert an equal net outwards force on all surfaces of the tin can. The net force on each surface of the can will be zero, and the tin can will not get crushed, no matter how high the water pressure is.\n\nIn general, if there is an interface with fluid on either side of it a different pressures, it is the difference in pressure on either side of the interface that determines the net force exerted on the interface, rather than the absolute pressure.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nYou place a tin can on a table, and use a pump to create a vacuum inside of the can. You observe that the tin can gets crushed. Which explanation is correct?\n\nBy sucking the air out of the can, you also suck in on the walls of the can.\n\nYou lower the pressure inside the can so that the air outside the can exerts a larger inwards force on the can than the outwards force from the air inside the can.\n\nYou lower the pressure inside the can so that the air inside the can exerts a pulling force on the walls of the can.\n\nAll of the above are all valid ways to model this.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#pressure","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"The effect of gravity","lvl2":"Pressure"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/fluidmechanics#the-effect-of-gravity","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"The effect of gravity","lvl2":"Pressure"},"content":"When discussing \n\nFigure 2, we argued that the fluid exerts an equal force, from all directions, on the fluid element, so that the net force on the fluid element is zero. This is not quite correct in the presence of gravity, where the fluid element will have a weight. Thus, if the fluid element is to be in equilibrium, the upwards force (and pressure) from the fluid below must be higher than that from the fluid above the fluid element.\n\nFigure 4 shows an element of fluid that has a height h and a surface area A in the horizontal plane. The pressure, P_2, in the fluid below the fluid element must be higher than the pressure, P_1, above the fluid element, if the fluid element is in equilibrium.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:In the presence of gravity, the pressure below an element of fluid must be larger if the fluid element is to remain in equilibrium.\n\nThe element of fluid has a total mass, m, given by:m = \\rho V = \\rho Ah\n\nwhere, V=Ah, is the volume of the fluid, and, ρ, its density.\n\nThe net (horizontal) force exerted by the external fluid on the fluid element is zero along the vertical surfaces. Let P_1 be the pressure in the fluid above the fluid element, and P_2 be the pressure below the fluid element. If we choose a y axis that is positive upwards and the fluid element does not accelerate in the vertical direction, then the y component of Newton’s Second Law, written for the fluid element, is:\\sum F_y = F_2 - F_1 -mg &= 0\\\\\nP_2A - P_1A-mg &=0\\\\\nP_2A - P_1A-\\rho Ahg &=0\\\\\n\\therefore P_2 - P_1 = \\rho gh\n\nwhere we used the fact that the force resulting from a pressure is given by the pressure multiplied by the area over which it is exerted. We thus find that the difference in pressure due to gravity in a fluid between two positions, y_2 and y_1, is given by:\\boxed{P(y_2) - P(y_1) = -\\rho g (y_2 - y_1)}\n\nwhere the y axis is defined to increase in the upwards direction. Since the pressure in the fluid depends on the location in the fluid, we say that there is a “pressure gradient” in the fluid.\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Holding water in a vertical straw.\n\nYou use your finger to block off the top end of a straw and then remove the straw from a glass of water. What is the most correct description of why the water stays in the straw (\n\nFigure 5) before you release your finger?\n\nThe straw cannot have vacuum inside of it; unless the finger is removed to let air in to replace the water, the water will remain in the straw.\n\nThere is a small amount of vacuum above the water that sucks the water upwards and prevents it from dropping.\n\nThe pressure of the air in the straw below the water is higher than the pressure of the air in the straw above the water.\n\nThe pressure of the air in the straw below the water is lower than the pressure of the air in the straw above the water.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nWe have assumed that the density of the fluid, ρ, is constant, and that the fluid cannot be compressed. This is a very good approximation for a liquid such as water, but not for a gas, whose density will depend on its pressure. If the fluid were a gas (e.g. a column of air in our atmosphere), both the density and the pressure will change as a function of height. We can easily take this into account in our model, if we consider the fluid element to have a very small height, dy, instead of the finite height, h, as in the derivation above. A fluid element with an infinitesimal height, dy, is illustrated in \n\nFigure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Pressure gradient from gravity on an infinitesimal fluid element.\n\nIn the very small height, dy, the density of the fluid, ρ, can be taken to be constant, and the infinitesimal element of fluid will have a mass dm:dm = \\rho A dy\n\nWe can model the pressure exerted by the fluid above the fluid element as P+dP, and the pressure exerted by the fluid below as P, where dP is a small (negative) change in pressure. The y component of Newton’s Second Law written for the infinitesimal fluid element is thus:\\sum F_y = PA - (P+dP)A -dm g &=0\\\\\nPA -PA -dPA - \\rho A dy g &=0\\\\\n\\therefore -dP -\\rho gdy &=0\n\nWe can thus determine how pressure changes with height, y:\\boxed{\\frac{dP}{dy} = -\\rho g}\n\nThis tells us that the rate of change of pressure with increasing y is negative; in other words, the pressure decreases as the elevation increases, as we had already concluded. We can integrate the equation to obtain the change in pressure in going from y_1 to y_2:dP &= -\\rho g dy\\\\\n\\int_{P_1}^{P_2} dp&=-\\int_{y_1}^{y_2}\\rho gdy\\\\\n\\therefore P_2-P_1 &=-\\int_{y_1}^{y_2}\\rho gdy\n\nIf the density, ρ, is constant, then this leads to \n\n(4). Note that, thus far, we have only modelled how pressure in a fluid changes with height, but we have not determined the absolute pressure in a fluid.\n\nExample 14.1\n\nIf we assume that the density of air is proportional to its pressure, how does the density of air change with altitude?\n\nSolution\n\nWe know that the rate of change of pressure with altitude (position y, where positive y is defined to be upwards) is given by:\\frac{dP}{dy} &= -\\rho g\n\nSince we can assume that the density is proportional to the pressure, we can introduce an arbitrary constant, a, and state that:\\rho &=aP\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{dP}{dy} &=  \\frac{d}{dy} \\frac{1}{a} \\rho = \\frac{1}{a}  \\frac{d\\rho}{dy}\n\nwhere the constant a can be evaluated if we know the pressure and density at some point. We can thus write that the rate of change of the density with position y is given by: \\frac{1}{a} \\frac{d\\rho}{dy} &= -\\rho g\\\\\n \\therefore \\frac{d\\rho}{dy} &= -ag \\rho\n\nThis is a separable differential equation for ρ, allowing us to separate the variables and integrate from, say, an altitude of y=0, where the density is \\rho_0, to an altitude y, where the density is ρ:\\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho} &= - ag dy\\\\\n\\int_{\\rho_0}^{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho} &= -\\int_{0}^{y}agdy\\\\\n\\ln(\\rho)-\\ln(\\rho_0)&= -agy\\\\\n\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0} \\right)&= -agy\n\nWe can take the exponential on each side of the equation to get rid of the logarithm:\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0} &= e^{-agy}\\\\\n\\therefore \\rho(y) &= \\rho_0e^{-agy}\n\nWe thus find that the density of the air decreases exponentially with altitude. This is why it is more difficult to breathe at high altitude. Since we assumed that the density of the air is proportional to its pressure, the air pressure will also decrease exponentially with increasing altitude:P(y) &= P_0e^{-agy}\n\nwhere P_0 is the pressure at an altitude of y=0. If we know P_0 and \\rho_0, then the constant a is given by:a = \\frac{\\rho_0}{P_0}\n\nDiscussion: If we applied this model to the Earth’s atmosphere, our model would only provide qualitative agreement, as the density of the air also depends on its temperature and other factors. Nonetheless, it is interesting that, based on the simple requirement that an element of air be in hydrostatic equilibrium, we are able to obtain a reasonable description of how pressure and density change with altitude in the Earth’s atmosphere.","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#the-effect-of-gravity","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Pascal’s Principle","lvl2":"Pressure"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/fluidmechanics#pascals-principle","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Pascal’s Principle","lvl2":"Pressure"},"content":"Pascal’s Principle states that if an external pressure is exerted on a fluid, the pressure everywhere in the fluid increases by that amount.

What is the magnitude of the force, \\vec F, that must be applied on the smaller piston in order to lift the mass, M?\n\nSolution\n\nIf a force \\vec F is applied to the small piston, then the pressure in the fluid will increase by:\\Delta P = \\frac{F}{A}=\\frac{F}{\\pi \\frac{D^2}{4}}=\\frac{4F}{\\pi D^2}\n\nThis will result in a net upwards force, \\vec F', on the large piston, with a magnitude:F' = \\Delta P A' = \\Delta P \\pi D^2 = \\frac{4F}{\\pi D^2} \\pi D^2 = 4F\n\nThus the force on the large piston will be four times that exerted on the small piston. One only needs to exert a force with a magnitude of Mg/4 in order to lift the mass, M.","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#pascals-principle","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Measuring pressure","lvl2":"Pressure"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/fluidmechanics#measuring-pressure","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Measuring pressure","lvl2":"Pressure"},"content":"In this section, we describe how one can design instruments to measure pressure. The most straightforward device is a manometer, which is constructed using a U-shaped tube filled with a fluid of known density, ρ, as shown in \n\nFigure 10.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A manometer can measure the difference between a pressure P and atmospheric pressure, P_0. That difference is called “gauge pressure”.\n\nA manometer can be used to measure a pressure P relative to atmospheric pressure, P_0. One end of the tube is open to atmospheric pressure, and the other is connected to the fluid (e.g. a gas) for which we want to measure the pressure. If the pressure being measured is larger than atmospheric pressure, the fluid in the manometer will experience a greater downwards force on the side of the pressure to be measured than on the side open to atmospheric pressure, as shown in \n\nFigure 10. There will be a difference, h, in the level of the fluid on each side of the tube, which is directly proportional to the difference in pressure between the two sides of the tube.\n\nConsider the point in the fluid at location B in \n\nFigure 10, where the pressure is P_B=P, the pressure to be measured. The point in the fluid at location A, which is at the same height in the fluid, must have the same pressure as point B. We can write the pressure at point A, P_A, as the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the pressure from the column of water of height, h:P_A=P_0+\\rho g h\n\nSince this must also be equal to the pressure at point B, we can find the difference between the pressure we want to measure and atmospheric pressure:P_A &= P_B \\\\\nP_0+\\rho g h &= P\\\\\n\\therefore P - P_0 &= \\rho g h\n\nThe difference between a pressure and the atmospheric pressure is called “gauge pressure”, and is all that we can measure if we do not know the absolute value of the atmospheric pressure. Using a manometer, the gauge pressure is given by \\rho g h, whereas the “absolute pressure”, P, is given by adding the atmospheric pressure to the gauge pressure, P = P_0 + \\rho g h. Most pressure measuring devices (“pressure gauges”), measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, using a similar mechanism.\n\nThe atmospheric pressure at a location on Earth varies based on the weather. A barometer is an instrument designed to measure the atmospheric pressure. A simple barometer can be built from a manometer, with one end closed, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 11.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:A barometer constructed from a manometer to measure relative changes in atmospheric pressure.\n\nOne end of the manometer is sealed on a day where the atmospheric pressure is, say, P_0, while the other end of the tube is left open. The height difference, h, between the fluid in either side of the tube is a measure of how different the current atmospheric pressure, P_1, is relative to the pressure, P_0, when the manometer was sealed. In \n\nFigure 11, the barometer is shown on a day where the atmospheric pressure is lower than on the day the manometer was sealed. The difference in pressure is given by:P_1 = P_0 + \\rho g h\n\nif we define h to be positive when the side with the pressure P_0 is higher (so h is negative in \n\nFigure 11 and P_1 is less than P_0).\n\nWe can also measure the absolute atmospheric pressure if we evacuate the air out of the sealed end of the tube, so that P_0=0. When doing so, the difference in height between the fluid on either side of the manometer is a measure of the absolute atmospheric pressure.\n\nExample 14.3\n\n\n\nFigure 12:A barometer constructed from a manometer to measure absolute atmospheric pressure.\n\nUsing a manometer filled with water (\\rho=1\\times 10^3 {\\rm kg/m^3}), you construct a barometer to measure the absolute atmospheric pressure by evacuating the air from one side of the manometer, as shown in \n\nFigure 12. What is the difference in height, h, when the atmospheric pressure is “nominal” P_1=1.013\\times 10^5 {\\rm Pa}?\n\nSolution\n\nThe pressure, P_1, on the open side of the manometer is given by:P_B &= P_A\\\\\nP_1&= P_0 + \\rho g h = \\rho g h\n\nif the sealed side of the manometer has a pressure, P_0=0, above the fluid. If P_1=1.013\\times 10^5 {\\rm Pa}, we can find the height, h:h=\\frac{P_1}{\\rho g}=\\frac{(1.013\\times 10^5 {\\rm Pa})}{(1000 {\\rm kg/m^3})(9.8 {\\rm m/s^2})}=10.3 {\\rm m}\n\nDiscussion: The difference in height is about 10 {\\rm m} when the atmospheric pressure is nominal. This means that the manometer needs to be at least this tall to measure absolute atmospheric pressure, which is not practical to construct! If, instead, one uses a liquid with a higher density than that of water, then this height can be reduced substantially. Traditionally, barometers have been built using mercury, which has a density of (\\rho_{Hg}= 13.6\\times 10^3 {\\rm kg/m^3}), so that the height difference at nominal atmospheric pressure is 760 {\\rm mm}. This is a much easier instrument to build (apart from the safety concerns of using mercury). For this reason, an often-used unit of pressure is “mm of mercury”, which corresponds to the height difference in a manometer that is built using mercury.\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nFigure 13:A Torricelli barometer.\n\nYou build a Torricelli barometer, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 13, to measure the absolute atmospheric pressure. The sealed vertical tube has a space at the top that is evacuated (a pressure of zero), so that atmospheric pressure on the container of liquid forces the liquid up the tube to a height, h, which is proportional to atmospheric pressure. If you use olive oil as the liquid, what can you say about the height, h, for nominal atmospheric pressure?\n\nIt is greater than 10.3 {\\rm m}.\n\nIt is equal to 10.3 {\\rm m}.\n\nIt is less than 10.3 {\\rm m}.\n\nNot enough information to tell.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#measuring-pressure","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl2":"Buoyancy"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/fluidmechanics#buoyancy","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl2":"Buoyancy"},"content":"In this section, we examine how the pressure gradient in a fluid leads to a force of buoyancy on an object that is immersed in the fluid.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:(Left:) The weight of a fluid element, \\vec F_g, is supported by the net upwards force from the pressure, \\vec F_B, of the fluid below it. (Right:) If the fluid element is removed and replaced with an object, there will still be the same net upwards force, \\vec F_B, from the pressure of the fluid, which is now exerted on the object.\n\nIn the left panel of \n\nFigure 14, we show a hemi-spherical element of fluid with a volume V. The weight of the element of fluid, \\vec F_g, is supported by the net upwards force, \\vec F_B, exerted by the pressure of the fluid surrounding the fluid element. The mass, M, of the element of fluid is given by:M = \\rho V\n\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid. The net force from the pressure, F_B, must thus have the same magnitude as the weight:F_B = Mg = \\rho V g\n\nNow, suppose that the fluid element is “displaced” and replaced by the hull of a boat, as shown in the right panel of \n\nFigure 14. The net upwards force from the pressure of the fluid must remain the same, F_B, but that force is now exerted on the hull of the boat. We call that force the force of “buoyancy”, which is the reason that a boat can float and the reason that you feel lighter when walking in a swimming pool than on land.\n\nThus, if an object displaces a volume, V, of a fluid with density ρ, when immersed in the fluid, that object will experience an upwards force of buoyancy, \\vec F_B, with magnitude:\\boxed{F_B = \\rho V g}\n\nThis “principle” was originally discovered by Archimedes, who stated that the force of buoyancy is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Note that we drew the fluid element at the surface of the fluid, but this is not required, and a force of buoyancy will be present if the object is completely immersed in the liquid. If you refer back to \n\nFigure 4, you will recall that the net upwards force on an element of fluid must be equal to its weight, even if the fluid element is completely immersed.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nDoes the force of buoyancy on a fully submerged object increase with the depth at which the object is submerged (ignoring any change from the varying value of \\vec g)?\n\nYes, because the force of buoyancy comes from the pressure in the fluid, which increases with depth.\n\nNo, because the force of buoyancy comes from the difference in pressure above and below the object, which does not increase with depth.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\nYou observe that if you pour olive oil slowly into your glass of water, the oil floats above the water. What can you conclude?\n\nThe mass of a given volume of oil is less than the mass of the same volume of water.\n\nThe mass of a given volume of oil is more than the mass of the same volume of water.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 14.4\n\nYou measure the weight of an object by suspending it with a spring scale. When you measure the weight of the object in air, you find that it has a weight W_{a}. When you measure the weight of the object when it is completely submerged in water, you find that it has a weight W_w. What is the density of the object?\n\nSolution\n\nGiven the weight of the object in air, we can easily determine its mass:M = \\frac{W_a}{g}\n\nHowever, since we do not know its volume, V, we cannot directly determine its density. When the object is submerged in water, the measured weight will be the actual weight of the object (as measured in air) minus the magnitude of the force of buoyancy exerted by the water:W_w &= W_a - \\rho_w g V\\\\\n\\therefore V &= \\frac{W_a -W_w}{\\rho_w g}\n\nwhere \\rho_w is the density of water. Given the volume, we can now determine the object’s density, ρ:\\rho = \\frac{M}{V}=\\frac{W_a\\rho_w g}{g (W_a -W_w)}=\\rho_w\\frac{W_a}{W_a -W_w}\n\nDiscussion: By using Archimedes’ Principle, we were able to determine the volume, and thus the density of the object, by comparing measurements of its weight in air and in water. This is similar to the method that Archimedes came up with to determine if a crown owned by a general was made of real gold or if some of the gold had been replaced with an equal weight of silver. Archimedes supposedly went to the baths to ponder how to determine if the crown was made of gold and had his Eureka moment when we he noticed the water level in the bath went up as he went into the bath. He realized that denser gold would displace less water than silver for an equal weight.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nWhether or not an object will float depends on its density. Let’s consider an object that is placed in water. The only forces acting on the object are its weight and the force of buoyancy. We want to know when the net force will be zero. I’m going to write out Newton’s Second Law for the object, but writing the mass of the object in terms of its density and volume.F_g&=F_B\\\\\nm_Og&=F_B\\\\\n\\rho_OV_Og&=\\rho_WV_Wg\n\nwhere O refers to the object and W refers to the water. Cancelling out the g’s, we can write this as:\\frac{\\rho_O}{\\rho_W}=\\frac{V_W}{V_0}\n\nConsider a solid cube that has the same density as water. In this case, \\rho_0/\\rho_W=1, and so V_W/V_0=1. This means that, in order for the cube to float, a volume of water that is equal to the volume of the cube must be displaced. So, the entire cube must be submerged. If you placed this cube 5 {\\rm m} deep in the water, it would stay at this depth.\n\nNow consider a cube whose density is half that of water. We find that \\rho_0/\\rho_W=0.5, so we must have V_W/V_0=0.5. In order for the cube to float, only half of it needs to be submerged. If you placed the cube 5 {\\rm m} deep in the water, it would rise to the surface and stop when half of it was above water (after bobbing for a bit).\n\nFinally, what about a cube whose density is 1.5 times the density of water? In this case, one and a half cubes worth of water would have to be displaced in order for the cube to float. Even when the entire cube is submerged, not enough volume has been displaced in order for it to float, so the cube will sink.\n\nObjects like pool noodles or life jackets allow us to float because they have low densities. They have very little mass (they don’t add much to the weight) in a relatively large volume (they can displace water to add to the buoyant force). An object with a density less than water will float with some fraction of the object being submerged.","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#buoyancy","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl2":"Hydrodynamics"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/fluidmechanics#hydrodynamics","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl2":"Hydrodynamics"},"content":"In the previous sections we developed “hydrostatic” models for fluids when those fluids are at rest (in some inertial reference frame).

The equation of continuity is based on the premise that the fluid that enters the pipe must exit the pipe, as there is nowhere else for the fluid to go. That is, if during a period of time, \\Delta t, a mass, \\Delta m, of fluid enters the wide end of the pipe, then during that same period of time, the same mass of fluid must exit the narrow end of the pipe.\n\nDuring a period of time, \\Delta t, the fluid at the wide end of the pipe will travel a distance l_1=v_1\\Delta t.

We will restrict ourselves to discussing the laminar flow of an incompressible fluid with no friction. Bernoulli was the first to quantitatively describe the flow of incompressible fluids, and we will show in this section how to derive “Bernoulli’s Principle”.\n\nConsider the laminar flow of an incompressible fluid through a pipe that changes height, from y_1 to y_2, as well as cross-sectional area, from A_1 to A_2, as shown in \n\nFigure 18. The figure shows an element of fluid, in blue, as it moves through the pipe. The top panel corresponds to the location of the fluid element at time t=0, whereas the bottom panel shows the location of the element of fluid at time t=\\Delta t.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:Laminar flow of an incompressible fluid through a pipe that changes cross-sectional area and height in the direction of flow. An element of fluid, in blue, is shown at time t=0 (top panel), and then, at a later time, t=\\Delta t (bottom panel).\n\nTo model how the fluid moves through this pipe, we can use energy and the Work-Energy Theorem. We start by considering the amount of work done on the element of fluid as it moves from the position in the top panel to the position in the bottom panel.\n\nThe fluid that is to the left of the element of fluid exerts a pressure, P_1, on the fluid element that leads to a net force, \\vec F_1, towards the right. Similarly, the fluid to the right of the element of fluid exerts a net force \\vec F_2 in the opposite direction, due to the pressure P_2 on that side of the fluid element.\n\nIn a period of time, \\Delta t, the left part of the fluid element will move a distance l_1 = v_1 \\Delta t, while the right part of the fluid element will move a distance l_2=v_2\\Delta t. We can calculate the work done by each force, defining positive work to be in the direction of motion:W_1 &=  F_1l_1 = (P_1A_1)(v_1 \\Delta t)\\\\\nW_2 &= -F_2l_2 = -(P_2A_2)(v_2 \\Delta t)\n\nGravity will also do (negative) work on the fluid as it changes height. In a period of time, \\Delta t, a mass of fluid, \\Delta m, will move from position y=y_1 to position y=y_2. The mass of fluid that changes height is given by the part of the fluid that moves a distance, l_1, on the right side of the pipe:\\Delta m = V_1 \\rho = A_1 l_1 \\rho = A_1 v_1 \\Delta t \\rho\n\nBecause of the equation of continuity, this is also equal to the mass of fluid that moves a distance, l_2, on the left side of the pipe:\\Delta m = V_2 \\rho = A_2 l_2 \\rho = A_2 v_2 \\Delta t \\rho\n\nsince A_1v_1 = A_2 v_2.\n\nThe force of gravity will thus do negative work on that mass element:W_g = -\\Delta m g (y_2-y_1) = -(A_1 v_1 \\Delta t \\rho) g (y_2-y_1)\n\nThe net work done on the element of fluid over the time \\Delta t is thus:W^{net} &= W_1+W_2+W_g = P_1A_1v_1 \\Delta t - P_2A_2v_2 \\Delta t -A_1 v_1 \\Delta t \\rho g (y_2-y_1)\n\nNote that, because of the equation of continuity, A_1v_1 = A_2 v_2, we can factor out a A_1v_1 from each term:W^{net} &=A_1v_1 \\Delta t \\Bigl(P_1- P_2 - \\rho g (y_2-y_1)\\Bigr)\n\nThe net work done on the fluid must equal the change in kinetic energy, \\Delta K, of the mass element, \\Delta m, from one end of the pipe to the other:\\Delta K &= \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta m v_2^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta m v_1^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}( A_1 v_1 \\Delta t \\rho) (v_2^2 - v_1^2)\n\nUsing the Work-Energy Theorem, we have:W^{net} &=\\Delta K\\\\\nA_1v_1 \\Delta t \\Bigl(P_1- P_2 - \\rho g (y_2-y_1)\\Bigr) &= \\frac{1}{2}( A_1 v_1 \\Delta t \\rho) (v_2^2 - v_1^2)\\\\\nP_1 - P_2 - \\rho g (y_2-y_1)&= \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2\n\nWe can re-arrange this so that all the quantities for each side of the pipe are on the same side of the equation:P_1 +\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2+ \\rho g y_1= P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g y_2\n\nSince the locations 1 and 2 that we chose are arbitrary, we can state that, for laminar incompressible flow, the following quantity evaluated at any position is a constant:\\boxed{P +\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2+ \\rho g y=\\text{constant}}\n\nThis statement is what we call Bernoulli’s Equation, and is equivalent to conservation of energy for the fluid. If the fluid is not flowing (v_1=v_2=0), then this is equivalent to the statement of hydrostatic equilibrium that we derived in \n\n(4):P_1 + \\rho g y_1= P_2 + \\rho g y_2\\\\\n\\therefore P_2 - P_1 = - \\rho g (y_2 - y_1)\n\nIf the flow of the fluid is at constant height (y_2=y_1), then Bernoulli’s equation can be written as:P_1 +\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2\n\nIf a fluid is flowing at constant height such that v_2 > v_1 (as in \n\nFigure 16), then P_2<P_1; that is, the pressure in the fluid is lower if the fluid is flowing faster. Note that P is the pressure inside the fluid and is not related to the force that would be exerted by the fluid if it were to collide with an object. It makes sense that the fluid has a lower pressure where it is moving faster, because the net force exerted on the fluid is related to the difference in pressure on either side of the fluid. The fluid will accelerate in the direction where pressure decreases, thus it will be moving faster when it is in a region of low pressure.\n\nBernoulli’s principle can be used to describe many phenomena. For example, an airplane wing (technically, an “airfoil”) creates lift because the pressure of the air above the wing is lower than the pressure of the air below the wing. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 19, which shows that the laminar flow of the air creates a low pressure area above the wing. As the stream lines of air encounter the wing, those that are above the wing get compressed together, which leads to a faster speed of the air above the wing (equation of continuity). The resulting difference in air pressure above and below the wing results in a net upwards force on the wing.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:Laminar flow of air around a airfoil. The curvature of the asymmetric airfoil forces the streamlines above the airfoil together, increasing the speed of the air due to the continuity equation, and resulting in a low pressure area.\n\nBernoulli’s principle also describes why the roof can be lifted off of a house in high winds (\n\nFigure 20, left panel). It is not the force of the wind against the roof that blows the roof off of a house; it is the difference in air pressure in the house (normal) and the pressure above the roof (low, due to the flowing wind), that results in a net upwards force on the roof. Bernoulli’s principle is also used to construct atomizers which allow liquid in a bottle to be sprayed (\n\nFigure 20, right panel). For example, perfume bottles often have a bulb connected to a tube/spout. When you squeeze the bulb, it causes the air in the tube to flow quickly, creating a low pressure in the vertical segment of the spout. The liquid is forced up by the pressure in the bottle; once the liquid arrives in the fast flowing air, it is sprayed out along with the air.\n\n\n\nFigure 20:(Left:) the wind flowing above a roof creates a low pressure zone above the roof. (Right:) air flowing above a vertical spout in the atomizer creates a low pressure zone; the air pressure in the bottle forces the liquid up the spout.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhen a high speed train is travelling at constant speed, is there a net force on the windows from air pressure?\n\nNo, since the windows are stationary relative to the train, there is no net force on them from air pressure.\n\nYes, there is a net outwards force on the windows from air pressure.\n\nYes, there is a net inwards force on the windows from air pressure.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe following examples illustrate how to apply Bernoulli’s principle.\n\nExample 14.6\n\n\n\nFigure 21:Water leaking out of a horizontal hole in a water tank.\n\nA water tower is constructed so that the bottom of the water tank is a height h_2 above the ground, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 21. The water in the tank is at a height h_1 from the bottom of the tank. A leak from a hole is found at the base of the tank (the water flows horizontally out of the hole). What is the horizontal distance, d, from the bottom of the tower to where the water from the leak hits the ground? Assume that the water level in the tank is constant and that atmospheric pressure does not change appreciably over the height of the tower.\n\nSolution\n\nThe pressure in the water tank leads to the water exiting the bottom of the tank with a horizontal velocity of magnitude, v. That water then undergoes projectile motion on its way to the ground. We can first determine the speed of the water exiting the tank and then use the kinematics for projectile motion to model the distance, d.\n\nWe model the flow of the water using a two-dimensional coordinate system with a horizontal x axis (positive to the right), and a vertical y axis (positive upwards). We place the origin at the bottom of the water tower, on the ground, below the hole, as shown in \n\nFigure 21.\n\nAt the top of tank, at a height y = h_1+h_2, the water has a speed of zero and is at atmospheric pressure, P_0. At the exit of the hole at the bottom of the tank, at a height y = h_2, the water has a speed v_2 and is also at atmospheric pressure. Using Bernoulli’s equation at the top (1) and bottom (2) of the tank, we have:P_1 +\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2+ \\rho g y_1&= P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g y_2\\\\\nP_0 + (0) + \\rho g (h_1+h_2) &= P_0 +  \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho g h_2\\\\\n\\therefore v_2 &= \\sqrt{2gh_1}\n\nwhich is exactly the speed that any object falling a distance h_1 would have.\n\nUsing kinematics, we can find the time that it would take the water to fall a distance h_2 (where the water’s velocity is horizontal as it exits the tank):h_2 &= \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\\\\n\\therefore t &= \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_2}{g}}\n\nThe distance d covered by the water is thus given by:d &= v_2t = \\sqrt{2gh_1}\\sqrt{\\frac{2h_2}{g}} = \\sqrt{4h_1h_2}\n\nDiscussion: We find that the water coming out of the bottom of the tank, when there is a height, h_1, of water above it providing pressure, will have the same speed as that of a particle which has fallen a distance, h_1. This is because there is no net pressure difference between the top of the water tank and where the water has exited the hole, so gravity is the only force doing work on the water. Gravity will do work at the same rate on particles of water as on any other particle, so the speed of the water particles at the bottom of the tank is the same as if they had fallen a distance, h_1. Again, once the water particles are falling through the air, gravity is the only net force exerted on those particles, so they undergo projectile motion, just as any other particle would.\n\nExample 14.7\n\nYou measure that water comes out of your kitchen faucet at a rate of 6 {\\rm l/min}. The faucet has a diameter of 2 {\\rm cm}. At what rate will water flow out of your basement faucet, which has a diameter of 1 {\\rm cm} and is located a height, h=3 {\\rm m}, below your kitchen faucet? Assume that atmospheric pressure, P_0, does not change appreciably between your kitchen and basement.\n\nSolution\n\nThe water flows out of the kitchen faucet at a speed, v_1, where the pressure is atmospheric. If the area of the kitchen faucet is A_1 we can determine the speed, v_1, from the given flow rate, Q_1=6 {\\rm l/min}=1\\times 10^{-4} {\\rm m^3/s}:Q_1 &= A_1 v_1\\\\\nv_1 &= \\frac{Q_1}{A_1}=\\frac{(1\\times 10^{-4} {\\rm m^3/s})}{\\pi (0.01 {\\rm cm})^2}=0.318 {\\rm m/s}\n\nThe water will flow out of the basement faucet with a speed, v_2, where the pressure is also atmospheric, P_0. We can use Bernoulli’s equation to relate the flow out of the basement faucet (2) to that at the kitchen faucet (1). We choose the y axis of a vertical coordinate system such that the basement is located at y_2=0 and the kitchen faucet is located at y_1=3 {\\rm m}:P_1 +\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2+ \\rho g y_1&= P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g y_2\\\\\nP_0+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2+ \\rho g y_1&= P_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} v_1^2+  gy_1&=  \\frac{1}{2} v_2^2 \\\\\n\\therefore v_2 &= \\sqrt{v_1^2 + 2gy_1}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{(0.318 {\\rm m/s})^2+2(9.8 {\\rm m/s^2})(3 {\\rm m})}=7.67 {\\rm m/s}\n\nThe corresponding flow rate at the basement faucet will be:Q_2 &= A_2 v_2 = \\pi(0.005 {\\rm m})^2(7.67 {\\rm m/s})=6.03\\times 10^{-4} {\\rm m^3/s}=36.17 {\\rm l/min}\n\nDiscussion: We find that the flow rate out of the basement faucet is six times that at the kitchen faucet. The speed of the water coming out of the basement faucet is more than 20 times the speed of the water at the kitchen faucet. Although it is true that one gets better water pressure out of a faucet that is lower in the building, this change in flow is unrealistically high, and this is a poor model for flow of water in the pipes of your house.\n\nYou can easily verify that the speed of the water in different levels of your house does not vary by a factor near 20 for a 3 {\\rm m} change in height (you could compare the flow rate for two faucets with the same diameter). This is because our model neglects the effect of friction as water flows in the pipes; in reality, there is much greater pressure in the pipes than that due to gravity, as well as a gradient in the pressure in your pipes, that will lead to the flow rates being similar in your kitchen and basement.","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#bernoullis-principle","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Viscosity","lvl2":"Hydrodynamics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/fluidmechanics#viscosity","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Viscosity","lvl2":"Hydrodynamics"},"content":"So far, we have assumed that fluids flow with no friction. In reality, the particles moving in  a fluid exert internal friction on each other called “viscosity”. This can be modelled as the friction between different layers of fluid in a laminar flow. For example, you may notice that the water that flows in a wide river flows much faster in the middle of the river than near the river banks, where the water is almost stationary, as shown in \n\nFigure 22.\n\n\n\nFigure 22:Water flowing in a river; the water near the banks is almost immobile due to the viscosity of the water.\n\nOne can model the banks of the river as exerting a frictional force on the layer of water that is in contact with the banks. That layer then exerts a frictional force on the next layer closer to the centre of the river, and so on.\n\nOne can define a viscosity coefficient, η, based on measuring the force required to pull a plate past another plate when there is a fluid between the plates. Consider two plates that have an area, A, that are a distance l apart, and contain the fluid of interest between them, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 23.\n\n\n\nFigure 23:A fluid placed between a moving plate (top) and a fixed plate (bottom) in order to measure the viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe viscosity of the fluid is defined based on the force that is required to pull the top plate while the bottom plate remains immobile. The layer of fluid directly below the moving plate will move with the plate at a speed, v, while the layer of fluid immediately in contact will the stationary plate will also be stationary. Moving one plate will thus lead to a gradient (a change) in the speed of the fluid as a function of the position between the two plates. The magnitude of the force, \\vec F,  required to move one plate with speed, v, was empirically determined to be proportional to the area of the plates, A, and the speed, v, while being inversely proportional to the distance, l, between the two plates:F \\propto A\\frac{v}{l}\n\nThe constant of proportionality is defined as the viscosity, η, of the fluid:\\boxed{F = \\eta A\\frac{v}{l}}\n\nIf the viscosity of the fluid is zero, then no force is required to pull the plate. The more viscous the fluid, the more difficult it is to pull the top plate. You can experiment with this by comparing the force required to move a small piece of paper across the top of a puddle of water and across the top of honey.\n\nThe presence of viscosity means that any fluid that flows will lose mechanical energy due to internal friction (which will heat up the fluid). Thus, Bernoulli’s equation is not correct if the fluid has viscosity, as a fluid cannot flow through a horizontal pipe without a change in pressure to overcome the losses due to friction.","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#viscosity","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Poiseuille flow","lvl2":"Hydrodynamics"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/fluidmechanics#sec-fluidmechanics-poiseuille","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl3":"Poiseuille flow","lvl2":"Hydrodynamics"},"content":"For the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid through a pipe, one can postulate that the flow rate, Q, is proportional to the change in pressure, \\Delta P, across the pipe:Q \\propto \\Delta P\n\nwhere \\Delta P is taken as the positive difference between the pressure at either end of the pipe. The fluid flows from high pressure to low pressure. We can introduce a constant of proportionality, R, to be the “resistance of the pipe”, so that we can write:Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}\n\nwhere we wrote the constant of proportionality as 1/R, so that a larger value of R corresponds to a pipe with a higher resistance to flow. That is, for a given pressure difference, as one increases the resistance of the pipe, one decreases the flow rate through that pipe. The relationship above can be used to empirically determine the resistance of a pipe.\n\nThe flow through a pipe with a given resistance will be zero if there is no pressure gradient in the fluid along the pipe. Conversely, if there is no flow of fluid in the pipe, the pressure is the same everywhere in the pipe. We can thus also view a drop in pressure in a pipe to be the result of flow of liquid through the pipe. The pressure cannot drop across a horizontal pipe if there is no flow.\n\nWhen you close the tap on your kitchen faucet, the pressure inside the faucet is close to the pressure in the main water line that supplies your house. As soon as you open the tap and allow water to flow, the pressure in your faucet drops to atmospheric pressure, and the resulting pressure gradient from the main supply forces water to flow out of the faucet. If you try to plug your kitchen faucet with your thumb and stop the flow of water, you will need to exert a force large enough to overcome the pressure that exists in the main water supply. You will find that it is practically impossible to stop the flow of water with your thumb, as the pressure in the main supply needs to be high enough to overcome the resistance of the pipes and still result in a usable flow of water.\n\nPoiseuille first developed a model for the laminar flow of a liquid through a uniform horizontal cylindrical pipe of length, L, with a circular cross-section with radius r. He found that the resistance of such a pipe to a fluid of viscosity, \\eta , is given by:R = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r^4}\n\nThis makes some intuitive sense, as we expect more resistance (more impedance to flow), if the pipe is longer and if the fluid is more viscous (the resistance is zero if there is no viscosity). We further expect less resistance if the pipe has a larger radius. The resistance found by Poiseuille goes down as the fourth power of the radius. Thus, a pipe that is twice as wide will have a volume flow that is 2^4=16 times larger because of the reduced resistance.\n\nThe laminar flow rate, Q, of a viscous fluid through a pipe of length L and radius R, when there is a pressure difference \\Delta P, is given by:\\boxed{Q =  \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta L}\\Delta P}\n\nThis is usually referred to as “Poiseuille’s Equation”.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nDoes the flow rate of water out of a garden hose depend on the length of the hose?\n\nNo, since the volume of water entering the hose must also exit the hose, it does not matter how long the hose is.\n\nYes, the resistance of the hose depends on its length, so the pressure drop across the hose will change, and so will the flow rate.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 14.8\n\nYou are modelling the flow of water for a city. Two houses are connected in parallel to the main water supply, so that water from the main supply flows into either house 1 or house 2, and the flows out of each house then join up again at the main supply. The difference in pressure, \\Delta P, between the entry and exit point of water is the same for each house, and each house can be modelled as having a net resistance, R_{1} or R_2, to the flow of water, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 24. If you model the two houses as being the equivalent of a single “effective” house with an effective resistance R, what is the value of R in terms of R_1 and R_2?\n\n\n\nFigure 24:Flow of water being separated into two parallel paths that join up again.\n\nSolution\n\nThe water from the main will have to flow through either house 1 or house 2. If the flow rate through the main is Q, we require that this be equal to the sum of the flow rates through each house:Q = Q_1 + Q_2\n\nThe flow through each house is related to the pressure difference, \\Delta P, across each house (which is the same), as well as the resistance of that house:Q_1 &= \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_1}\\\\\nQ_2 &= \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_2}\n\nThe total flow rate is thus:Q = Q_1 + Q_2&=\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_1}+\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_2}\\\\\n&=\\Delta P \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R2}\\right)\n\nWe can write this as the flow through an effective resistance, R, with a pressure difference \\Delta P:Q &= \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}\\\\\n\\therefore R&= \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R2}}\n\nDiscussion: By requiring that the sum of the flows of water through the houses be the same as the flow rate through the main pipe, we were able to model the two houses as a single effective house with resistance R. You may notice that this is the same relation as the equivalent resistance for two electrical resistors combined in parallel. This is because the flow of electrical current in a resistor can be modelled using similar tools to those required for modelling the flow of a viscous fluid in a pipe.","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#sec-fluidmechanics-poiseuille","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/fluidmechanics#summary","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 14 - Fluid mechanics","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"The pressure from a force, \\vec F, exerted over a surface with area, A, is a scalar quantity defined as:P = \\frac{F_\\perp}{A}\n\nwhere F_\\perp is the component of the force perpendicular to the surface.\n\nIf a force is exerted on the particles in a fluid (e.g. gravity), a pressure will exist everywhere in the fluid.

The magnitude of the buoyancy force is given by Archimedes’ Principle:F_B = \\rho Vg\n\nwhere, ρ, is the density of the fluid and, V, is the volume of the fluid displaced by the object (i.e. the volume of the part of the object that is immersed in the fluid).\n\nWe can distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow of fluids. In laminar flow, individual particles in the fluid follow well-defined streamlines. In turbulent flow, individual particle follow complicated paths that usually involve Eddy currents. In general, it is much easier to model the laminar flow of fluids.\n\nThe equation of continuity states that the mass flow rate of a fluid through a closed system must be the same everywhere in the system (no fluid can appear or disappear). For laminar flow of a fluid with density, ρ, flowing at speed, v, through a pipe with cross section, A, the mass flow rate is a constant:\\rho A v= \\text{constant}\n\nA fluid is said to be incompressible if it has constant density. For a fluid of constant density, the volume flow rate, Q, must be constant everywhere in a closed system:Q = Av = \\text{constant}\n\nBernoulli’s Principle, which is based on the conservation of mechanical energy, states that the following quantity is a constant:P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho g y= \\text{constant}\n\nfor the laminar flow of a fluid with no viscosity. P is the internal pressure of the fluid, v its speed, and y the height of the fluid relative to a fixed coordinate system. In particular, Bernoulli’s Principle implies that, for a constant height, the internal pressure of a fluid must decrease if its speed increases.\n\nViscosity, η, for the laminar flow of a fluid can be modelled as the result of the internal friction force between layers of the fluid. Because of viscosity, a fluid cannot flow in a horizontal pipe unless there is a difference in pressure across the pipe. Similarly, there will be no horizontal pressure gradient through a fluid unless the fluid is flowing.

The forces acting on the door are the force of buoyancy, the door’s weight, and the weights of Rebecca and Ryan, as shown in \n\nFigure 27.\n\n\n\nFigure 27:The forces acting on the door when Rebecca and Ryan are on top of it.\n\nWe can combine the weight of the door and the weight of the people into the total weight, F_g. We choose the y axis to be positive upwards. The sum of the forces on the door in the y direction is given by:\\sum F_y = F_B- F_g\n\nFor the door to float, the net force on the door must be greater than or equal to zero. We want to find the minimum buoyant force for them to float, so we set the net force equal to zero:F_g&=F_B\\\\\n(m_R+m_r+m_d)g&=\\rho_wV_wg\\\\\nm_R+m_r+m_d&=\\rho_wV_w\n\nwhere the weight includes the mass of Rebecca (m_R), Ryan (m_r) and the door (m_d). We added the subscript W to the right side of the equation to remind ourselves that the buoyant force depends on the density and volume of the displaced water. We want to find the maximum density of the wood in order for Rebcca and Ryan to stay above the water’s surface. This means that the maximum volume of water that can be displaced is the volume of the door, V_w=V_d (so that the surface of the door is level with the surface of the water, as in \n\nFigure 25). We can rewrite the mass of the door in terms of its volume and density, and apply our condition that V_w=V_d :m_R+m_r+\\rho_dV_d&=\\rho_wV_d\\\\\n\\rho_d&=\\frac{\\rho_wV_d-m_R-m_r}{V_d}\n\nA quick calculation tells us that the volume of the door is (2 {\\rm m})(1 {\\rm m})(0.12 {\\rm m})=0.24 {\\rm m^3}.

However, it is unlikely that a random floating door is made of balsa wood (although one would choose lighter materials when constructing a ship).\n\nb. No, they could not both stay on the door because the density of oak is greater than the maximum density of 527 {\\rm kg/m^3}.

Given that the pressure in the patient’s veins is 80 {\\rm mm Hg} above atmospheric pressure, we want to find the pressure required at the other end of the needle so that we get the desired flow rate through the needle. We model the needle as a horizontal cylindrical pipe and assume that the saline solution exhibits laminar flow. We can therefore use Poiseuille’s equation:Q=\\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta L}(P_1-P_2)\n\nWe let P_1 be the pressure where the needle connects to the tube. Solving for P_1 gives:P_1=Q\\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r^4}+P_2\\\\\n\nThe pressure at the exit of the needle, P_2, is just the blood pressure (80 {\\rm mm Hg} + 1 {\\rm atm}). The radius of the needle is 0.60 {\\rm mm}/2=0.30 {\\rm mm}. The flow rate has to be in units of {\\rm m^3/s}.

We can  easily determine the height of the IV bag that is required to give the desired pressure. We choose a coordinate system with a y axis that is vertical (positive upwards) with the origin at the location of the needle (\n\nFigure 28).\n\n\n\nFigure 28:The needle is at height 0 and the top of the fluid in the IV bag is at y_0.\n\nAt the top of the solution in the IV bag, y_0, the solution has a speed of zero and is at atmospheric pressure, P_0=1 {\\rm atm}. The velocity at the needle is 0, and the pressure is 13457 {\\rm Pa}+1 {\\rm atm}. Bernoulli’s principle states:P_0+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_0^2+\\rho gy_0=P_1+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2+\\rho gy_1\\\\\n\nUsing our values to solve for y_0, we get:P_0+\\rho gy_0&=P_1\\\\\ny_0&=\\frac{P_1-P_0}{\\rho g}\\\\\ny_0&=\\frac{13457 {\\rm Pa}+1 {\\rm atm}-1 {\\rm atm}}{(997 {\\rm kg/m^3})(9.8 {\\rm m/s^2})}\\\\\ny_0&=\\frac{13457 {\\rm Pa}}{(997 {\\rm kg/m^3})(9.8 {\\rm m/s^2})}\\\\\ny_0&=1.4 {\\rm m}\n\nTherefore, the IV bag should be placed 1.4 {\\rm m} above the patient’s arm.\n\nWe placed the dP on the top part of the fluid, even though the pressure is higher on the bottom part of the fluid, because the y axis increases upwards. We are really interested in the change in pressure, dP, that corresponds to a change in height, dy, along the positive y direction.\n\nIf the velocity of the fluid is not perpendicular to the surface, then v is the component of the velocity perpendicular to the surface.","type":"content","url":"/fluidmechanics#solutions","position":33},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/chargesfields","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview"},"content":"title: Chapter 15 - Electric charges and fields\nnumbering:\n  headings:\n  heading_1:\n    start: 16\ndownloads:\n    - file: _build/pdf/15ChargesFields.pdf\n\t- file: ./15ChargesFields.md\n\nIn this and subsequent chapters, we start to look at the theories that describe electric and magnetic phenomena.

For example, on a dry winter day, you might find that after rubbing your bare feet on a polyester carpet, you feel a small electric shock upon touching a metallic surface such as a doorknob. You probably also know that there are positive and negative charges, and that equal charges repel each other whereas opposite charges attract. In this chapter, we develop the description of how these charges can accumulate and how they exert attractive or repulsive forces on each other.\n\nOrdinary matter is made of atoms, which are themselves made of a small positive nucleus (containing positive protons and neutral neutrons) surrounded by a “cloud” of negatively charged electrons. Within a solid object, inter-atomic forces hold the atoms together, so we can model the atoms as being effectively stationary. This means that we can treat the positive nuclei as being fixed in space. The negative electrons, depending on the material, can often move from one atom to another. If an atom loses an electron to another atom, it becomes positive, whereas the atom that acquired the extra electron becomes negative.\n\nWe define the net charge on an atom (or an object) based on whether there are more protons (positive), more electrons (negative) or an equal amount (neutral). By default, atoms are neutral and have an equal number of protons and electrons. An object becomes charged when it acquires an excess (or deficit) of electrons from another object. We say that “charge is conserved” because the number of electrons in the system does not change, i.e. if one object became positively charged, a different object must have become negatively charged by the same amount, so that the total net charge (in the Universe) is zero.\n\nWhen you rub two objects together, you allow electrons to be transferred between them. Different materials have different “affinities” for electrons, and the electrons will transfer to the object with the highest affinity. Returning to our earlier example, when you rub your bare feet on the polyester carpet, electrons are being removed from your feet and deposited onto the carpet. Since your feet lose electrons, you acquire a net positive charge, while the carpet acquires a net negative charge. This way of creating a net charge on an object is called “charging by friction”. If you then touch a doorknob, electrons will jump from the doorknob and onto your (now positively charged) body, creating a spark.\n\nThe “triboelectic series” is a list of materials that tend to give up or acquire electrons when they are placed in close contact with each other. Some common materials from the series are shown in \n\nFigure 1.  The greatest charge is generated by rubbing together materials that are the furthest apart from each other in the diagram. Rubbing silk on a piece of glass results in more charge than rubbing wool on the same piece of glass.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:A sample of a triboelectric series of materials. The materials on the right-hand side have the greatest affinity to acquire electrons.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIf you rub a glass rod with silk, which object ends up with an excess of electrons?\n\nglass rod.\n\nsilk.\n\nneither, they remain neutral.\n\nboth will acquire an excess of electrons.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/chargesfields#electric-charge","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Conductors and insulators","lvl2":"Electric charge"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/chargesfields#conductors-and-insulators","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Conductors and insulators","lvl2":"Electric charge"},"content":"We can broadly classify materials into conductors (such as metals), and insulators (such as wood), depending on how easily the electrons can move around in the material. In a conductor, electrons (rather, the outer electron(s) of an atom) are only loosely bound to their nuclei, and they can thus move around the material freely. In an insulator, the electrons are tightly bound to the nuclei of their atoms and cannot easily move around. There is a third class of materials, semi-conductors, that falls somewhere between a conductor and an insulator. In a semi-conductor, electrons are typically bound to their atoms, but any additional electrons present in the material can move around as if they are in a conductor.\n\nWithin a conductor, such as a solid metallic sphere, charges can move around freely. If that sphere has a net charge, for example an excess of electrons, those excess electrons will migrate to the outer surface of the sphere. Electrons in the sphere repel each other and will quickly settle into a position where they are, on average, the furthest from all of the other electrons, which occurs if all of the electrons migrate to the surface. This is illustrated in the left panel of \n\nFigure 2. If an initially neutral conducting sphere is connected to the charged sphere by a conducting wire (right panel of \n\nFigure 2), some of the electrons will “conduct” (transfer) onto the surface of the neutral sphere, so that, on average, they are further from all other electrons. This way of adding charge to the neutral sphere is called “charging by conduction”, and the second sphere will remain charged if the connection between spheres is broken.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Charging by conduction: a neutral conducting sphere is connected to a negatively charged conducting sphere. The charges can “spread out more” if some of the charges move (“conduct”) from the charge sphere onto the neutral sphere.","type":"content","url":"/chargesfields#conductors-and-insulators","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Electrostatic induction","lvl2":"Electric charge"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/chargesfields#electrostatic-induction","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Electrostatic induction","lvl2":"Electric charge"},"content":"Electrostatic induction allows one to “induce” a charge by using the fact that charges can move freely in a conductor. The left panel of \n\nFigure 3 shows a (neutral) rod made of a conducting material, with electrons distributed uniformly throughout its volume. In the right panel, a negatively charged sphere is brought next to the rod. The negative sphere repels the electrons in the rod. Since the rod is conducting, the electrons can move around easily, and so they move to the end of the rod that is furthest from the negative sphere. Those electrons will leave positive charges (corresponding to the atoms that have lost their electrons) on the side closest to the sphere. The electrons in the rod will only accumulate for as long as the force from the negative sphere is greater than the repulsive force from the electrons that have already accumulated. In practice, such an equilibrium is reached almost instantly. In equilibrium, we say that the rod is “polarized”, or that the “charges in the rod have separated”, although the rod is overall still neutral.\n\nNote that we can model this as if it where positive charges that move inside of the rod instead of negative charges. The positive charges are attracted to the negative sphere, and thus accumulate on the end of the rod closest to the sphere, leaving a negative charge on the other end. The choice to call electrons “negative” is completely arbitrary. For convenience, we usually build models assuming that positive charges can easily move around, even if, in reality, it is almost always actually (negative) electrons that move.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Electrostatic induction: when a negatively charged sphere is brought close to a neutral conducting rod, the electrons in the rod, which can move freely, accumulate on the side of the rod furthest from the sphere, leaving an excess of positive charge near the sphere.\n\nWe can create a net charge on the polarized rod if we provide a conducting path for charges to leave (or enter) the rod. The Earth can be modelled as a very large reservoir of both positive and negative charges. By connecting the rod to the Earth (we say that we connect the rod to “ground”), we provide a path for the electrons in the rod to be even further from the negatively charged sphere, and they can thus leave the rod entirely in order to go into the ground. This is illustrated in the right-hand panel of \n\nFigure 4.\n\nIf we then disconnect the rod from the ground, it has now acquired an overall positive charge, as in the right hand panel. We call this “charging by induction”. We can also think of this in terms of positive charges moving into the rod from the Earth; when we connect the rod to the ground, the positive charges in the Earth can move into the rod and get closer to the negatively charged sphere. If we disconnect the rod from the ground, the rod stays positive, just as we conclude when using a model where it is the negative charges that move.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Charging by induction: when we connect the polarized rod to the ground, electrons can leave the rod. If we now disconnect the rod from ground, the rod is left with an overall positive charge.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nBefore we leave this section, let’s take a minute to summarize the different methods for charging an object.\n\nCharging by friction: We start with two neutral objects. To charge the objects, we rub them together. We end up with two oppositely charged objects. To explain this, we need to know that atoms can exchange electrons when they are in close contact and that different materials have different affinities for electrons.\n\nCharging by conduction: We start with one neutral object and one charged object. To charge the neutral object, we put it in contact with the charged object. Charges move from the charged object to the neutral object, so we end up with two objects that are both positive or both negative. To explain this, we need to know that like charges repel, and that charges can move around freely inside conductors.\n\nCharging by induction: We start with one neutral object and one charged object. To charge the neutral object, we move the charged object close to (but not touching) the neutral object to separate the charges in the neutral object. We then use some mechanism (e.g. connecting to ground) to create a net charge. We end up with one positively charged object and one negatively charged object. Once again, we need to know that like charges repel, and that charges can move around freely in conductors.","type":"content","url":"/chargesfields#electrostatic-induction","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The Coulomb force"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/chargesfields#the-coulomb-force","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The Coulomb force"},"content":"Coulomb was the first to provide a detailed quantitative description of the force between charged objects. Nowadays, we use the (derived) SI unit of “Coulomb” (C) to represent charge. The “charge” of an object corresponds to the net excess (or lack) of electrons on the object. An electron has a charge of -e=-1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm C}. Thus, an object with a charge of -1 {\\rm C} has an excess of about \\frac{1}{1.6\\times 10^{-19}}=6.25\\times 10^{18} electrons on it, which is a very large charge. If an object has an excess of electrons, it is negatively charged and we indicate this with a negative sign on the charge of the object. An object with a (positive) charge of 1 {\\rm C} thus has a deficit of 6.25\\times 10^{18} electrons.\n\nThrough careful studies of the force between two charged spheres, Coulomb observed[^41] that:\n\nThe force is attractive if the objects have opposite charges and repulsive if the objects have the same charge.\n\nThe force is inversely proportional to the squared distance between spheres.\n\nThe force is larger if the charges involved are larger.\n\nThis leads to Coulomb’s Law for the electric force (or simply “Coulomb’s Law”), \\vec F_{12}, exerted on a point charge Q_1 by another point charge Q_2:\\boxed{\\vec{F}_{12}=k\\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\hat{r}_{21}}\n\nwhere \\hat r_{21} is the unit vector from Q_2 to Q_1 and r is the distance between the two charges, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 5. Coulomb’s constant, k=8.99\\times 10^9 {\\rm N\\cdot m^2/C^{2}}, is simply a proportionality constant to ensure that the quantity on the right will have units of Newtons when all other quantities are in S.I. units. In some instances, it is more convenient to use the “permittivity of free space”, \\epsilon_0, rather than Coulomb’s constant, in which case Coulomb’s Law has the form:\\vec F_{12}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\hat r_{21}\n\nwhere \\epsilon_0=\\frac{1}{4\\pi k}=8.85\\times 10^{-12} {\\rm C^2\\cdot N^{-1}\\cdot m^{-2}} is a more fundamental constant, as we will see in later chapters.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Vectors involved in applying Coulomb’s Law.\n\nIf the two charges have positions \\vec r_1 and \\vec r_2, respectively, then the vector \\hat r_{21} is given by:\\hat r_{21} = \\frac{\\vec r_2 - \\vec r_1}{||\\vec r_2 - \\vec r_1||}\n\nCoulomb’s Law is mathematically identical to the gravitational force in Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity. Rather than quantity of mass determining the strength of the gravitational force, it is the quantity of charge that determines the strength of the electric force. The only major difference is that gravity is always attractive, whereas the Coulomb force can be repulsive.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nThe Coulomb force is conservative.\n\nTrue.\n\nFalse.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe product Q_1Q_2 in the numerator of Coulomb’s force is positive if the two charges have the same sign (both positive or both negative) and negative if the charges have opposite signs. Again, referring to \n\nFigure 5, if the two charges are positive, the force on Q_1 will point in the same direction as \\hat r_{21} (since all of the scalars are positive in Coulomb’s Law) and thus be repulsive. If, instead, the two charges have opposite signs, the product Q_1Q_2 will be negative and the force vector on Q_1 will point in the opposite direction from \\hat r_{21} and the force is attractive.\n\nExample 15.1\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the electric force between the electron and the proton in a hydrogen atom and compare this to the gravitational force between them.\n\nSolution\n\nWe model this by assuming that the electron and proton are point charges a distance of 1 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm A}=1\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm m} apart (1 Angstrom is about the size of the hydrogen atom). The proton and electron have the same charge with magnitude e=1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm C}, so the (attractive) electric force between them has a magnitude of:F_e &= k\\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\\\\n&=(9\\times 10^9 {\\rm N\\cdot m^2/C^{2}})\\frac{(1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm C})(1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm C})}{(1\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm m})^2}\\\\\n&=2.3\\times 10^{-8} {\\rm N}\n\nwhich is a small number, but acting on a very small mass. In comparison, the force of gravity between an electron (m_e=9.1\\times 10^{-31} {\\rm kg}) and a proton (m_p=1.7\\times 10^{-27} {\\rm kg}) is given by:F_g&=G\\frac{m_em_p}{r^2}\\\\\n&=(6.7\\times 10^{-11} {\\rm Nm^2/kg^2})\\frac{(9.1\\times 10^{-31} {\\rm kg})(1.7\\times 10^{-27} {\\rm kg})}{(1\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm m})^2}\\\\\n&=1.04\\times 10^{-47} {\\rm N}\n\nDiscussion: As we can see, the electric force between an electron and a proton is 39 orders of magnitude larger than the gravitational force! This shows that the gravitational force is extremely weak on the scale of particles and has essentially no effect in particle physics. Indeed, the best current theory of particle physics, and the most precisely tested theory in physics, the “Standard Model”, does not need to include gravity in order to provide a spectacularly precise description of particles. One of the big challenges in theoretical physics is nonetheless to develop a theory that integrates the gravitational force with the other forces.\n\nIn the following trinket, a positive and negative charge are drawn. The force each charge experiences is drawn as an arrow and calculated for a distance of 1 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm A}=1\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm m} apart. Following convention, the vector arrows have their origin at the charge experiencing the force. When the trinket is run, the force arrows indicate an attractive force, i.e., the charges experience forces toward one another. If the charges are changed to like charges, e.g., Q1.q = q and Q2.q = q, the force arrows indicate repulsion between the charges. Try it in the trinket below. What happens to the size of the force vectors if you make one charge twice as big as the other? Can you support this result with one of Newton’s Laws?\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A trinket demonstrating Coulomb Force between opposite charges.\n\nExample 15.2\n\nThree charges, Q_1=1 {\\rm nC}, Q_2=-2 {\\rm nC}, and q=-1 {\\rm nC}, are held fixed at the three corners of an equilateral triangle with sides of length a=1 {\\rm cm}, with a coordinate system as shown in \n\nFigure 7.

For example, if we place a charge q=-1 {\\rm nC} (as in \n\nThree charges arranged in an equilateral triangle of side a.), we can easily find the corresponding electric force:\\vec F_q &= q\\vec E=(-1 {\\rm nC})\\left[ (13.5\\times 10^{4} {\\rm N/C})\\hat x-(8.2\\times 10^{4} {\\rm N/C})\\hat y \\right]\\\\\n&=-(13.5\\times 10^{-5} {\\rm N})\\hat x+(8.2\\times 10^{-5} {\\rm N})\\hat y\n\nas we found previously. Note that the force on q is in the opposite direction of the electric field vector. This is because q is negative. The electric field at some point in space thus points in the same direction as the force that a positive test charge would experience.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we determined the net electric field by making use of the superposition principle; namely, that we can treat the electric fields from Q_1 and Q_2 independently, without needing to consider the fact that Q_1 and Q_2 exert forces on each other. By knowing the electric field at some position in space, we can easily calculate the force vector on any test charge, q, placed at that position. Furthermore, the sign of the charge q will determine in which direction the force will point (parallel to \\vec E for a positive charge and anti-parallel to \\vec E for a negative charge).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nThe electric field inside of a conductor must be zero because...\n\nIf there is an electric field, electrons will move (since it is a conductor) and arrange themselves so as to create an additional field that cancels the original field\n\nIf there is an electric field, protons will move (since it is a conductor) and arrange themselves so as to create an additional field that cancels the original field\n\nSince electrons can move freely, they move so fast that the electric field is negligible.\n\nElectric fields cannot penetrate conducting materials.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/chargesfields#the-electric-field","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Visualizing the electric field","lvl2":"The electric field"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/chargesfields#visualizing-the-electric-field","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl3":"Visualizing the electric field","lvl2":"The electric field"},"content":"Generally, a “field” is something that has a different value at different positions in space. The pressure in a fluid under the presence of gravity is a field: the pressure is different at different heights in the fluid. Since pressure is a scalar quantity (a number), we call it a “scalar field”. The electric field is called a “vector field”, because it is a vector that is different at each position in space. One way to visualize the electric field is to draw arrows at different positions in space; the length of the arrow is then proportional to the strength of the electric field at that position, and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of the electric field. The electric field for a point charge is shown using this method in \n\nFigure 11.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:Electric field vectors near a point charge.\n\nOne disadvantage of visualizing a vector field with arrows is that the arrows take up space, and it can be challenging to visualize how the field changes magnitude and direction continuously through space. For this reason, one usually uses “field lines” to visualize a vector field. Field lines are continuous lines with the following properties:\n\nThe direction of the vector field at some point in space is tangent to the field line at that point.\n\nField lines have a direction to indicate the direction of the field vector along the tangent (as there are two possibilities, parallel and anti-parallel).\n\nThe magnitude of the field is proportional to the density of field lines at that point. The more field lines near a location in space, the larger the magnitude of the field vector at that point.\n\nAn example of using field lines to represent a vector field in space is shown in \n\nFigure 12. The corresponding field vector is shown at two different positions in space (A and B). At both positions, the vector is tangent to the field line at that position in space and points in the direction of the little arrow drawn at the end of the field lines. The field vector at point A has a larger magnitude than the one at point B, since the field lines are more concentrated at point A than at point B (there are more field lines per unit area at that position in space, the field lines are closer together).\n\n\n\nFigure 12:An example of determining a field vector from the continuous field lines.\n\nCheckpoint:label: cp:chargesfields:efield\n\nIt is possible for field lines to cross?\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nBecause the electric field vector always points in the direction of the force that would be exerted on a positive charge, electric field lines will point out from a positive charge and into a negative charge.

We can use the principle of superposition to determine the electric field from a charged extended/continuous object by modelling that object as being made of many point charges. The electric field from that object is then the sum of the electric field from the point charges that make up that object.\n\nConsider a charged wire that is bent into a semi-circle of radius R, as in \n\nFigure 14. The wire carries a net positive electric charge, +Q, that is uniformly distributed along the length of the wire. We wish to determine the electric field vector at the centre of the circle.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:A charged wire bent into a semi-circle of radius R.\n\nWe start by choosing a very small section of wire and model that section of wire as a point charge with infinitesimal charge dq (as in \n\nFigure 15). A distance R from that point charge, the electric field from that point charge will have magnitude, dE, given by:dE=k\\frac{dq}{R^2}\n\nThe electric field vector, d\\vec E, from the point charge dq is illustrated in \n\nFigure 15.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:Infinitesimal electric fields from point charges along the bent wire.\n\nUsing the coordinate system that is shown, we define θ as the angle made by the vector from the origin to the point charge dq and the x-axis. The electric field vector from dq is then given by:d\\vec E = dE\\cos\\theta \\hat x - dE\\sin\\theta \\hat y\n\nThe total electric field at the origin will be obtained by summing the electric fields from the different dq over the entire semi-circle:\\vec E &= \\int d\\vec E = \\int \\left(dE\\cos\\theta \\hat x - dE\\sin\\theta \\hat y\\right)\\\\\n&=\\left( \\int dE\\cos\\theta \\right)\\hat x -\\left( \\int dE\\sin\\theta \\right)\\hat y\\\\\n\\therefore E_x &= \\int dE\\cos\\theta\\\\\n\\therefore E_y &= -\\int dE\\sin\\theta\\\\\n\nWe are thus left with two integrals to solve for the x and y components of the electric field, respectively. Before jumping into solving the integrals, it is useful to think about the symmetry of the problem. Specifically, consider a second point charge, dq', located symmetrically about the x-axis from charge dq, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 15. The charge dq' will create a small electric field d\\vec E' as illustrated. When we add together d\\vec E and d\\vec E', the two y components will cancel, and only the x components will sum together. Similarly, for any dq that we choose, there will always be another dq' such that when we sum together their respective electric fields, the y components will cancel. Thus, by symmetry, we can argue that the net y component of the electric field, E_y, must be zero. We thus only need to evaluate the x component of \\vec E:E_x = \\int dE\\cos\\theta = \\int k\\frac{dq}{R^2} \\cos\\theta\n\nIn order to solve this integral, we need to consider which variables change for different choices of the point charge dq. In this case, the distance R is the same anywhere along the semi-circle, so only θ changes with different choices of dq, as k is a constant. We can express dq in terms of d\\theta and then use θ as the variable of integration (the variable that labels the different dq). d\\theta corresponds to a small change in the angle θ, and is the angle that is subtended by the charge dq. That is, the charge dq covers a small arc length, ds, of the semi-circle, which is related to d\\theta by:ds = Rd\\theta\n\nThe total charge on the wire is given by Q, and the wire has a length \\pi R (half the circumference of a circle). Since the charge is distributed uniformly on the wire, the charge per unit length of any piece of wire must be constant. In particular, dq divided by ds must be equal to Q divided by \\pi R:\\frac{dq}{ds}&=\\frac{Q}{\\pi R}\\\\\n\\therefore dq &=\\frac{Q}{\\pi R}ds=\\frac{Q}{\\pi}d\\theta\n\nwhere in the last equality we used the relation ds=Rd\\theta. We now have all of the ingredients to solve the integral:E_x &= \\int k\\frac{dq}{R^2} \\cos\\theta = \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{+\\pi/2} k\\frac{Q}{\\pi R^2}\\cos\\theta d\\theta\\\\\n&= k\\frac{Q}{\\pi R^2}\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{+\\pi/2}\\cos\\theta d\\theta=k\\frac{Q}{\\pi R^2}\\left[ \\sin\\theta \\right]_{-\\pi/2}^{+\\pi/2}\\\\\n&= k\\frac{2Q}{\\pi R^2}\n\nThe total electric field vector at the centre of the circle is thus given by:\\vec E = k\\frac{2Q}{\\pi R^2} \\hat x\n\nNote that if we had not realized that we did not need to solve the integral for the y component, we would still find that it is zero:E_y= -k\\frac{Q}{\\pi R^2}\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{+\\pi/2}\\cos\\theta d\\theta=-k\\frac{Q}{\\pi R^2}\\left[ -\\cos\\theta \\right]_{-\\pi/2}^{+\\pi/2}=0\n\nIn order to determine the electric field at some point from any continuous charge distribution, the procedure is generally the same:\n\nMake a good diagram.\n\nChoose a charge element dq.\n\nDraw the electric field element, d\\vec E, at the point of interest.\n\nWrite out the electric field element vector, d\\vec E, in terms of dq and any other relevant variables.\n\nThink of symmetry: will any of the component of d\\vec E sum to zero over all of the dq?\n\nWrite the total electric field as the sum (integral) of the electric field elements.\n\nIdentify which variables change as one varies the dq and choose an integration variable to express dq and everything else in terms of that variable and other constants.\n\nDo the sum (integral).\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nBefore we get into the next few examples, I’m going to review the set-up for the  semi-circular wire, and explain why it’s best to leave dq in our expression as long as possible.\n\nIn this example, we were given a charged, semi-circular wire and asked to find the electric field. When asked to solve a new problem like this, many of us would start by trying to find a formula that applies to the problem. However, we were only given one formula for the electric field, \\vec E = k\\frac{Q}{r^2}\\hat r, and this only applies to point charges. So, the only way that we can use this formula is to somehow make the semi-circular wire look like a bunch of point charges. To do this, we imagine that the wire looks like the left panel of \n\nFigure 16, where I have cut the wire into pieces, each of which has some charge, dq.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Left: Cutting up a wire with charge Q into pieces with length ds and charge dq. Right: Visualizing the semicircular wire as being made up of point charges.\n\nSince the pieces are very small, we can say that they are essentially point charges. Now, the problem looks something like the right panel of \n\nFigure 16, which we know how to solve. All we have to do is find the field from each point charge, \\vec E = k\\frac{Q}{r^2}\\hat r \\rightarrow d\\vec E = k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\hat r, and add them all up using an integral: \\vec E=\\int d\\vec E. From the symmetry of the problem, we find that the y contributions from the different point charges will cancel, so the  integral we need to solve is E_x=\\int k\\frac{dq}{R^2}\\cos\\theta.\n\nSince R and k are constant, we just have to integrate over θ. However, our integrand doesn’t contain any d\\theta to integrate over. That’s where our pal dq comes in. Now that we know we want to integrate over θ, we can choose to express dq in terms of d\\theta. Looking back at the left panel of \n\nFigure 16, how much charge, dq, is in each piece? Well, dq is just the charge of the whole wire, Q, divided by the length of the wire, \\pi R, times the length of the piece, ds. Since each piece is in the shape of an arc, we can get d\\theta into this expression by using the formula for arc length, ds=Rd\\theta. Therefore, dq=(Q/\\pi)( ds/R)=(Q/\\pi)d\\theta, and we can now solve the integral.\n\nExample 15.4\n\nA ring of radius R carries a total charge +Q. Determine the electric field a distance a from the centre of the ring, along the axis of symmetry of the ring.}\nIn order to determine the electric field, we carry out the procedure outlined above, and start by drawing a good diagram, as in \n\nFigure 17, showing: our coordinate system, our choice of dq, the electric field element vector d\\vec E that corresponds to dq, and variables (r, θ) to specify the position of dq.\n\n\n\nFigure 17:Determining the electric field on the axis of a ring of radius R carrying charge Q.\n\nSolution\n\nIn this case, the figure is challenging to draw and visualize because of the three-dimensional nature of the problem. With the specific dq that we chose, the electric field element vector is given by:d\\vec E = -dE\\sin\\theta \\hat x + 0\\hat y + dE\\cos\\theta \\hat z\n\nwhere d\\vec E has magnitude:dE = k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\n\nThe x and z components of the total electric field will then be given by:E_x &= -\\int dE\\sin\\theta=-\\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\sin\\theta\\\\\nE_z &= \\int dE\\cos\\theta=\\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\cos\\theta \\\\\n\nIn general, if we had chosen a dq that is not along one of the axes of the coordinate system, the electric field element vector would have components in all three directions. However, if we consider the symmetry of the ring, we can note that once we sum together all of the electric field elements, only the z components will survive. Indeed, we have shown in \n\nFigure 17 that for each dq, there will be a dq' located on the opposite side of the ring that will create an electric field element that will cancel all but the z component of the field element from dq. We thus only need to consider the z components of the electric field elements when determining the total electric field:\\vec E = E_z\\hat z\n\nWe now have to evaluate the integral for the z component of the electric field:E_z &= \\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\cos\\theta \\\\\n\nand determine which quantities change as we move dq around the ring. In this case, both r^2 and \\cos\\theta are the same for all elements on the ring, and the integral is trivial:E_z &= k\\frac{1}{r^2}\\cos\\theta\\int dq=k\\frac{Q}{r^2}\\cos\\theta=kQ\\frac{a}{(R^2+a^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}  \\\\\n\nwhere the integral \\int dq simply means “sum all of the charges dq together”, which is equal to Q, the total charge on the ring.\nIn the last equality, we replaced \\cos\\theta with the variables a and R that are provided in the question.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nIn this example, we saw why it’s best to leave dq in our expression until we are ready to integrate. In this case, because r and θ were both constant, it was not useful to write dq in terms of another variable.\n\nExample 15.5\n\nYou have rubbed a glass rod with a silk cloth such that the glass rod has acquired a positive charge. The rod has a length, L, a negligible cross-section, and has acquired a total positive charge, +Q, that is uniformly distributed along the length of the rod. What is the electric field a distance R from the centre of the rod?\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to determine the electric field, we carry out the procedure outlined above, and start by drawing a good diagram, as in \n\nFigure 18, showing: our coordinate system, our choice of dq at a distance y above the centre of the rod, the electric field element vector d\\vec E that corresponds to dq, and variables (y, r, θ) to specify the position of dq.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:Determining the electric field a distance R from the centre of a rod of length L carrying charge Q.\n\nWe define the origin to be located at the point where we want to determine the electric field, and the angle θ to be the angle between the horizontal and the position vector of dq. We can write the electric field element vector as:d\\vec E = dE\\cos\\theta \\hat x - dE\\sin\\theta \\hat y\n\nwhere d\\vec E has magnitude:dE = k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\n\nThe x and y components of the total electric field will then be given by:E_x &= \\int dE\\cos\\theta=\\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\cos\\theta \\\\\nE_y &= -\\int dE\\sin\\theta=-\\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\sin\\theta\\\\\n\nAgain, before proceeding with the integrals, we consider symmetry. Specifically, if we consider a charge dq' located symmetrically about the x axis from dq (as illustrated in \n\nFigure 18), we see that the y component of the electric field element d\\vec E' that it creates will cancel the y component of d\\vec E. For each choice of dq, there will exist a corresponding choice dq' which will result in the y component of the net electric field being zero. We thus only need to evaluate the x component of the total electric field:\\vec E = E_x \\hat x = \\left(\\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\cos\\theta\\right) \\hat x\n\nWithin the integrand, both r and θ will change as we sum over the different charges dq along the rod. A straightforward option to write the integral is to use y as the integration constant, and to write dq, r, and \\cos\\theta in terms of y. The charge dq covers an infinitesimal length of the rod, dy. Since the rod is uniformly charged, the charge per unit length must be the same over a small length dy as it is over the whole length of the rod:\\frac{dq}{dy}&=\\frac{Q}{L}\\\\\n\\therefore dq &= \\frac{Q}{L} dy\n\nIt is often useful to introduce a constant charge per unit length, \\lambda=\\frac{Q}{L}, so that we can write the charge dq as:dq = \\lambda dy\n\nWe can also express r^2 and \\cos\\theta in terms of y (and R, which is constant):r^2 &= y^2+R^2\\\\\n\\cos\\theta&=\\frac{R}{r}=\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{y^2+R^2}}\n\nFinally, we can combine this all into an integral that we can evaluate: E_x &= \\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\cos\\theta\\\\\n &= k\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\lambda \\frac{1}{y^2+R^2}\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{y^2+R^2}} dy\\\\\n &= kR\\lambda\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\frac{1}{(y^2+R^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} dy\\\\\n &= kR\\lambda \\left[  \\frac{y}{R^2\\sqrt{y^2+R^2}}\\right]_{-L/2}^{L/2}\\\\\n \\therefore E_x &= \\frac{k\\lambda}{R}\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2+R^2}}\n\nIf the rod were infinitely long (or very long compared to the distance R), the electric field becomes:\\lim_{L\\to\\infty}E_x=\\frac{2k\\lambda}{R}\n\nBy using the charge per unit length, λ, we were able to easily generalize our result to that expected for an infinitely long rod with uniform charge density.\n\nSolving the integral above in terms of the integration variable y is difficult without some knowledge of integrals. For this specific integral, the easiest method to use from calculus is “trig substitution”. We show below how we can arrive at a much easier integral if we had instead chosen the angle θ as the integration variable instead of y, and we will see that this is a physical illustration of the “trig substitution method” from calculus!\n\nWe go back to step 7 in our procedure and choose θ (instead of y) as the integration variable for the integral:E_x &=\\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\cos\\theta\\\\\n\nThat is, we need to express 1/r^2 and dq in terms of θ. To do this, we refer back to \n\nFigure 18. Starting with 1/r^2, we get:r &= \\frac{R}{\\cos\\theta}\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{1}{r^2}&=\\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{R^2}\\\\\n\nNow we need to find an expression for dq. We know that dq=\\lambda dy, and λ is just a constant, so we need to find dy as a function of θ:y &= R\\tan\\theta\\\\\n\\therefore dy &= \\frac{dy}{d\\theta}d\\theta=\\frac{R}{\\cos^2\\theta}d\\theta\\\\\n\\therefore dq &= \\lambda dy =\\lambda\\frac{R}{\\cos^2\\theta}d\\theta\n\nwhere in the second line, we took the derivative of y=R\\tan\\theta with respect to θ. With these expressions for 1/r^2 and dq, the integral becomes trivial: E_x &= \\int k\\frac{dq}{r^2}\\cos\\theta\\\\\n &= k \\int_{-\\theta_0}^{\\theta_0} \\lambda\\frac{R}{\\cos^2\\theta} \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{R^2} \\cos\\theta d\\theta\\\\\n &=\\frac{k\\lambda}{R}\\int_{-\\theta_0}^{\\theta_0}\\cos\\theta d\\theta\\\\\n &=\\frac{k\\lambda}{R}\\left[\\sin\\theta \\right]_{-\\theta_0}^{\\theta_0}\\\\\n &= \\frac{2k\\lambda}{R}\\sin\\theta_0\n\nwhere \\theta_0 is the angle subtended by half of the rod. Referring to \n\nFigure 18, we can easily see that:\\sin\\theta_0=\\frac{L/2}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2+R^2}}\n\nSo that the total electric field is given by:E_x &=\\frac{2k\\lambda}{R}\\sin\\theta_0=\\frac{k\\lambda}{R}\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2+R^2}}\n\nas found before. Furthermore, in the limit of an infinitely long rod, the angle \\theta_0 tends to \\frac{\\pi}{2}, so that the electric field becomes:E_x=\\lim_{\\theta_0\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\frac{2k\\lambda}{R}\\sin\\theta_0=\\frac{2k\\lambda}{R}\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we saw how to apply the principle of superposition to determine the electric field near a finite and a infinite line of charge with constant charge per unit length. We showed that it was relatively straightforward to set up the integral in terms of dy, but not so easy to solve the integral. We then showed that by using θ as the integration variable, we could arrive at a much easier integral. This change of variable corresponds to a physical variable in our problem, but is also the basis for the more abstract “trig substitution” method used to solve integrals in calculus.\n\nExample 15.6\n\nCalculate the electric field a distance, a, above a infinite plane that carries uniform charge per unit area, σ.}\nIn this case, we need to determine the field above an object that is two dimensional (a plane). In the previous examples (a ring, a line of charge), we modelled a one dimensional object (e.g. the line), as being made of many point charges (0-dimensional objects). We treated those point charges has having an infinitesimal length along the object so that we could sum them together to obtain the object (e.g. dy was the length of the charge for the rod/line of charge).\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to model the two-dimensional object (the plane), we model it has being the sum of many one dimensional objects. We can model a plane either as a rectangle of width, W, and length, L, as shown in the left panel of \n\nFigure 19 or as a disk of radius, R, as shown in the right panel. To model an infinite plane, we can then take the limit of either L and W going to infinity (rectangle), or of R going to infinity (disk). We can model the rectangle as being the sum of many lines of finite length, L, and infinitesimal width, dx. Similarly, we can model the disk as the sum of infinitesimally thin rings of finite radius, r, and thickness, dr. In both cases, we know how to model the field from a line of charge (\n\nExample 15.5) or from a ring (\n\nExample 15.4).\n\n\n\nFigure 19:A two-dimensional object such as a plane modelled as a the sum of infinitely thin lines (left panel) or as the sum of infinitely thin rings (right panel).\n\nWe proceed by modelling the plane as a disk made up of infinitesimal rings. Our infinitesimal charge, dq, is thus the charge on a ring of radius r and thickness dr, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 20.\n\n\n\nFigure 20:Modelling the field from a disk as the sum of fields from concentric thin rings.\n\nWe know from \n\nDetermining the electric field on the axis of a ring of radius R carrying charge Q. that the magnitude of the electric field a distance a from the centre of the ring, along its axis of symmetry (the z axis in \n\nFigure 20), is given by:dE = kdq\\frac{a}{(r^2+a^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}\n\nBy symmetry, for all of the different infinitesimal rings that make up the disk, the field will always point along the z axis. In order to determine the total field, we sum (integrate) the values of dE, over all of the rings, from a radius of r=0 to a radius r=R. For each ring, the value of r will be different, so we need to express dq in terms of dr in order to perform the integral. We know that the plane has a uniform charge per unit area given by σ. The charge dq of an infinitesimal ring is given by:dq = \\sigma dA=\\sigma 2\\pi r dr\n\nwhere dA=2\\pi r dr is the area of the infinitesimal ring of radius r and thickness dr (think of unfolding the ring into a rectangle of height dr and length 2\\pi r, the circumference of the circle, in order to determine the area). We now have all of the ingredients in order to determine the total electric field:E &= \\int dE = \\int_0^R kdq\\frac{a}{(r^2+a^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}  = 2\\pi k a \\sigma \\int_0^R \\frac{r}{(r^2+a^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}dr\\\\\n&=2\\pi k a \\sigma \\left[  \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{r^2+a^2}}\\right]_0^R=2\\pi k  \\sigma\\left(1-\\frac{a}{R^2+a^2} \\right)\n\nFinally, we can take the limit of R\\to\\infty in order to get the electric field above an infinite plane:E=\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}2\\pi k  \\sigma\\left(1-\\frac{a}{R^2+a^2} \\right)=2\\pi k\\sigma=\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}\n\nwhere we used \\epsilon_0 in the last equality as the result is a little cleaner without the factors of π. Note that for an infinite plane of charge, the electric field does not depend on the distance (our variable a) from the plane!\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we showed how we can model a two-dimensional charge distribution as the sum of one-dimensional charge distributions. In particular, we showed that an infinite plane of charge can be modelled as the sum of many lines charges or of many rings of charge (we chose the latter in the above). We also found that the electric field above an infinite plane of charge does not depend on the distance from the plane; that is, the electric field is constant above an infinite plane of charge.\n\nJosh’s Thoughts\n\nA common source of confusion is the process of solving for the electric field produced by continuous charges. Point charges are well defined in space as being entirely contained within a single point, while continuous charges are objects which occupy 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. The electric field produced by point charges are easily modelled by \\vec E = \\frac{kQ}{r^2}\\hat r, but the electric fields produced by continuous charges must usually be obtained from an integral.\n\nWhen a charge is distributed, the charge on the object must be broken down into many small charges which are written as dq. From there, dq is rewritten in terms of a position variable over which it is convenient to integrate. Think of the position variable as a variable that you can use to distinguish charges, dq, located at different positions along the object.\n\nFor example, referring to \n\nFigure 21, if I wanted to determine E at the top of a rod (left-hand panel), it would be most convenient for me to integrate over x, but if I wanted to determine E on the side of a rod, it would be most convenient to integrate over θ.\n\n\n\nFigure 21:Calculating the electric field produced by a rod at different positions.\n\nIn order to determine the bounds of the integral, think of the range in position variable that is required in order to cover the entire object. I recommend paying close attention to \n\nExample 15.4, \n\nExample 15.5, and \n\nExample 15.6, and attempting questions which require integration on the Question Library.","type":"content","url":"/chargesfields#electric-field-from-a-charge-distribution","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The electric dipole"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/chargesfields#sec-chargesfields-electricdipole","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"The electric dipole"},"content":"Electric dipoles are a specific combination of a positive charge +Q held at a fixed distance, l, from an equal and opposite charge, -Q, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 22.\n\n\n\nFigure 22:An electric dipole and its corresponding dipole vector, \\vec p.\n\nDipoles can be represented by their “electric dipole vector” (or “electric dipole moment”), \\vec p, defined to point in the direction from the negative charge to the positive charge, with magnitude:p=Ql\n\nDipoles arise frequently in nature. For example, a water molecule can be modelled as a dipole. In a water molecule, the two hydrogen atoms are not symmetrically arranged around the oxygen atom. The electrons tend to stay closer to the oxygen atom, so the oxygen atom has an excess of 2 electrons, while each proton has a deficit of 1 electron. This results in a separation of charge (polarization), which can be modelled as an electric dipole, as in \n\nFigure 23.\n\n\n\nFigure 23:A water molecule can be modelled as an electric dipole.\n\nWhen a dipole is immersed in a uniform electric field, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 24, the net force on the dipole is zero because the force on the positive charge will always be equal to and in the opposite direction of the force on the negative charge.\n\n\n\nFigure 24:An electric dipole in a uniform electric field.\n\nAlthough the net force on the dipole is zero, there is still a net torque about its centre that will cause the dipole to rotate (unless the dipole vector is already parallel to the electric field vector). If the dipole vector makes an angle, θ, with the electric field vector (as in \n\nFigure 24), the magnitude of the net torque on the dipole about an axis perpendicular to the page and through the centre of the dipole is given by:\\tau&=\\frac{l}{2}F^+\\sin\\theta+\\frac{l}{2}F^-\\sin\\theta\\\\\n&=\\frac{l}{2}QE\\sin\\theta+\\frac{l}{2}QE\\sin\\theta\\\\\n&=QlE\\sin\\theta\\\\\n\\tau&=pE\\sin\\theta\n\nIn \n\nFigure 24, the torque vector is into the page (the forces will make it rotate clockwise), which is the same direction as the cross product, \\vec p \\times \\vec E. Note that the magnitude of the torque is also equal to the magnitude of the cross product. Thus, in general, the torque vector on a dipole, \\vec p, from an electric field, \\vec E, is given by:\\boxed{\\vec \\tau =\\vec p \\times \\vec E}\n\nIn particular, note that the torque is zero when the dipole and electric field vectors are parallel. Thus, a dipole will always experience a torque that tends to align it with the electric field vector. The dipole is thus in a stable equilibrium when it is parallel to the electric field.\n\nCheckpoint:label: cp:chargesfields:efield\n\nWhen an electric dipole is such that its dipole vector is anti-parallel to the electric field vector, the dipole is\n\nnot in equilibrium.\n\nin a stable equilibrium.\n\nin an unstable equilibrium.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nWe can also model the behaviour of the dipole using energy. If a dipole is rotated away from its equilibrium orientation and then released, it will gain (rotational) kinetic energy as it tries to return to equilibrium, and will oscillate about the equilibrium position. When the dipole is held out of equilibrium, we can think of it has having potential energy. To determine the functional form of that potential energy function, we consider the work done in rotating the dipole from an angle \\theta_1 to an angle \\theta_2 (where the angle is between the dipole and the electric field vectors):W&=\\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\tau d\\theta=\\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} -pE\\sin\\theta d\\theta=-pE\\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\sin\\theta d\\theta\\\\\n&=pE[\\cos\\theta]_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2}=pE\\cos\\theta_2-pE\\cos\\theta_1\n\nwhere the negative sign in the torque is to indicate that the torque is in the opposite direction from increasing θ (in \n\nFigure 24, the torque is clockwise whereas the angle θ increases counter-clockwise). The net work done in going from position \\theta_1 to \\theta_2 is the negative of the change in potential energy in going from \\theta_1 to \\theta_2. Thus, we define the potential energy of an electric dipole, \\vec p, in an electric field, \\vec E, as:\\boxed{U=-pE\\cos\\theta=-\\vec p\\cdot \\vec E}\n\nwhich has a negative sign, and we also recognize that this is equivalent to the scalar product between \\vec p and \\vec E. Note that the negative sign makes sense because systems experience a force/torque that will decrease their potential energy. When the angle is zero, \\cos\\theta=1, is maximal. Since we need the position with \\theta=0 to have the lowest potential energy, the minus sign guarantees that all values of θ other than zero will give a potential energy that is higher (greater than) (-1) pE. Remember that only changes in potential energy are relevant, so the minus sign should not bother you, although you should think about whether it makes sense.","type":"content","url":"/chargesfields#sec-chargesfields-electricdipole","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/chargesfields#summary","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"Objects can acquire a net charge if they acquire a net excess or deficit of electrons. Charges are never created, they are only transferred from one object to another. One can charge an object by friction, conduction, or induction. Materials can be classified broadly as conductors, where electrons can move freely in a material, or insulators, in which electrons remain tightly bound to the atoms in the material. If a conducting object acquires a net charge, those charges will migrate to the surface of the conductor.\n\nCoulomb was the first to quantitatively describe the electric force exerted on a point charge, Q_1, by a second point charge, Q_2, located a distance, r, away:\\vec F_{12}=k\\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\hat r_{21}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\hat r_{21}\n\nwhere \\hat r_{21} is the unit vector from  Q_2 to Q_1. One can write the force using either Coulomb’s constant, k, or the permittivity of free space, \\epsilon_0. Coulomb’s force is attractive if the product Q_1Q_2 is negative, and repulsive if the product is positive. Thus, charges of the same sign exert a repulsive force on each other, whereas opposite charges exert an attractive force on each other.\n\nMathematically, Coulomb’s Law is identical to the gravitational force in Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity, which implies that it is conservative. The electric field vector at some position in space is defined to be the electric force per unit charge at that position in space. That is, at some position in space where the electric field vector is \\vec E, a charge, q, will experience an electric force:\\vec F=q\\vec E\n\nmuch like a mass, m, will experience a gravitational force, m\\vec g, in a position in space where the gravitational field is \\vec g. A positive charge will experience a force in the same direction as the electric field, whereas a negative charge will experience a force in the direction opposite of the electric field. The electric field at position, \\vec r, from a point charge, Q, located at the origin, is given by:\\vec E = k\\frac{Q}{r^2}\\hat r\n\nOne can visualize an electric field by using “field lines”. The field vector at any point in space has a magnitude that is proportional to the number of field lines at that point, and a direction that is tangent to the field lines at that point.\n\nWe can model the electric field from a continuous charged object (i.e. not a point charge) by modelling the object as being made up of many point charges. Often, it is easiest to model an N-dimensional object as being the sum of objects of dimension N-1 and an infinitesimal length in the remaining dimension. For example, we modelled a line of charge as the sum of point charges that have an infinitesimal length, and we modelled a disk of charge as the the sum of rings that have an infinitesimal thickness. In general, the strategy to model the electric field from a continuous distribution of charge is the same:\n\nMake a good diagram.\n\nChoose a charge element dq.\n\nDraw the electric field element, d\\vec E, at the point of interest.\n\nWrite out the electric field element vector, d\\vec E, in terms of dq and any other relevant variables.\n\nThink of symmetry: will any of the component of d\\vec E sum to zero over all of the dq?\n\nWrite the total electric field as the sum (integral) of the electric field elements.\n\nIdentify which variables change as one varies the dq and choose an integration variable to express dq and everything else in terms of that variable and other constants.\n\nDo the sum (integral).\n\nFinally, we introduced the electric dipole, which is an object comprised of two equal and opposite charges, +Q and -Q, held at fixed distance, l, from each other. One can model an electric dipole using its dipole vector, \\vec p, defined to point in the direction from -Q to +Q, with magnitude:p=Ql\n\nWhen a dipole is immersed in a uniform electric field, \\vec E, it will experience a torque given by:\\vec\\tau=\\vec p\\times \\vec E\n\nThe torque will act such as to align the vector \\vec p with the electric field vector.

Flux is always defined based on:\n\nA surface.\n\nA vector field (e.g. the electric field).\n\nand can be thought of as a measure of the number of field lines from the vector field that cross the given surface. For that reason, one usually refers to the “flux of the electric field through a surface”. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 1 for a uniform horizontal electric field, and a flat surface, whose normal vector, \\vec A, is shown. If the surface is perpendicular to the field (left panel), so that the field vector is parallel to \\vec A, then the flux through that surface is maximal. If the surface is parallel to the field (right panel), then no field lines cross that surface, and the flux through that surface is zero. If the surface is rotated with respect to the electric field, as in the middle panel, then the flux through the surface is between zero and the maximal value.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Flux of an electric field through a surface that makes different angles with respect to the electric field. In the leftmost panel, the surface is oriented such that the flux through it is maximal. In the rightmost panel, there are no field lines crossing the surface, so the flux through the surface is zero.\n\nThe vector \\vec A is used to represent the surface. It is defined so that the magnitude of \\vec A is equal to the area of the surface and the direction of \\vec A is perpendicular to the surface, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 1. We define the flux, \\Phi_E, of the electric field, \\vec E, through the surface represented by vector \\vec A as:\\Phi_E=\\vec E\\cdot \\vec A=EA\\cos\\theta\n\nsince this will have the same properties that we described above (e.g. the flux is zero when \\vec E and \\vec A are perpendicular, and the flux is proportional to number of field lines crossing the surface). Note that, because we only require that \\vec A is perpendicular to the surface, there are two possible choices for the direction of \\vec A. As a result, the flux could be either positive or negative. By convention, we usually choose \\vec A so that the flux is positive.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nIn the most general terms, flux is the amount of something passing through an area. In the case of the electric flux, this is the number of electric field lines passing through a surface. We can draw parallels between the electric flux and a more intuitive example of flux: the amount of water flowing through a net. Imagine submerging a net in a flowing river. The amount of water that flows through the net will depend on the strength of the current (this is like E), the orientation of the net relative to the flow of water (\\cos\\theta), and the size of the net (A). When trying to conceptualize problems about electric flux, it sometimes helps to think of the field lines as representing water currents and the surface as representing a net in order to visualize what’s going on in the problem.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat are the S.I. units of electric flux?\n\n{\\rm N\\cdot m/C}\n\n{\\rm V\\cdot m}\n\n{\\rm V/m}\n\nThe units of flux depend on the dimensions of the charged object.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 16.1\n\nA uniform electric field is given by: \\vec E=E\\cos\\theta~\\hat x+E\\sin\\theta~\\hat y  throughout space. A rectangular surface is defined by the four points (0,0,0), (0,0,H), (L,0,0), (L,0,H). What is the flux of the electric field through the surface?\n\nSolution\n\nThe surface that is defined corresponds to a rectangle in the xz plane with area A=LH. Since the rectangle lies in the xz plane, a vector perpendicular to the surface will be along the y direction. We choose the positive y direction, since this will give a positive number for the flux (as the electric field has a positive component in the y direction). The vector \\vec A is given by:\\vec A =A\\hat y=LH\\hat y\n\nThe flux through the surface is thus given by:\\Phi_E&=\\vec E\\cdot \\vec A=(E\\cos\\theta\\hat x+E\\sin\\theta\\hat y)\\cdot(LH\\hat y)\\\\\n&=ELH\\sin\\theta\n\nwhere one should note that the angle θ, in this case, is not the angle between \\vec E and \\vec A, but rather the complement of that angle.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we calculated the flux of a uniform electric field through a rectangle of area, A=LH. Since we knew the components of both the electric field vector, \\vec E, and the surface vector, \\vec A, we used their scalar product to determine the flux through the surface. In some cases, it is easier to work with the magnitude of the vectors and the angle between them to determine the scalar product (although note that in this example, the angle between \\vec E and \\vec A is 90{\\degree}-\\theta).","type":"content","url":"/gauss#sec-gauss-flux","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl3":"Non-uniform fields","lvl2":"Flux of the electric field"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/gauss#non-uniform-fields","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl3":"Non-uniform fields","lvl2":"Flux of the electric field"},"content":"So far, we have considered the flux of a uniform electric field, \\vec E, through a surface, S, described by a vector, \\vec A.

What is the flux of the electric field through a square with side length L that is located in the positive xy plane with one of its corners at the origin?\n\nSolution\n\nWe need to calculate the flux of the electric field through a square of side length L in the xy plane. The electric field is always in the z direction, so the angle between \\vec E and d\\vec A (the normal vector for any infinitesimal area element) will remain constant. We can calculate the flux through the square by dividing up the square into thin strips of length L in the y direction and infinitesimal width dx in the x direction, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 3. We can do this because the electric field does not change with y, so the flux along each of these strips will be constant. If the electric field varied both as a function of x and y, we would start with area elements that have infinitesimal dimensions in both the x and the y directions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Dividing a square in the xy plane into thin strips of length L and width dx.\n\nAs illustrated in \n\nFigure 3, we first calculate the flux through a thin strip of area, dA=Ldx, located at position x along the x axis.

A plane, a triangle, and a disk are, on the other hand, examples of “open surfaces”.\n\nFor a closed surface, one can unambiguously define the direction of the vector \\vec A (or d\\vec A) as the direction that it is perpendicular to the surface and points towards the outside. Thus, the sign of the flux out of a closed surface is meaningful. The flux will be positive if there is a net number of field lines exiting the volume defined by the surface (since \\vec E and \\vec A will be parallel on average) and the flux will be negative if there is a net number of field lines entering the volume (as \\vec E and \\vec A will be anti-parallel on average). The flux through a closed surface is thus zero if the number of field lines that enter the surface is the same as the number of field lines that exit the surface. When calculating the flux over a closed surface, we use a different integration symbol to show that the surface is closed:\\Phi_E=\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A\n\nwhich is the same integration symbol that we used for indicating a path integral when the initial and final points are the same (see, for example, \n\nSection 8.2).\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A non-uniform electric field flowing through an irregularly shaped closed surface.\n\nA non-uniform electric field \\vec E flows through an irregularly-shaped closed surface, as shown in \n\nFigure 4. The flux through the surface is\n\npositive.\n\nzero.\n\nnegative.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nConsider the water flowing through a net analogy again, although now the net is a closed surface (e.g. a sphere). If there is more water flowing out of the net than into it, the flux is positive. If there is more flowing in than out, the flux is negative. If there is an equal amount of water flowing in and out, the flux is zero. If you had trouble with the last checkpoint question, try it again but now thinking about the field lines as a flow of water. Is there more water flowing in or out of the object, or is it the same?\n\nExample 16.3\n\nA negative electric charge, -Q, is located at the origin of a coordinate system. Calculate the flux of the electric field through a spherical surface of radius, R, that is centred at the origin.\n\nSolution\n\nFigure 5 shows the spherical surface of radius, R, centred on the origin where the charge -Q is located.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Calculating the flux through a spherical surface.\n\nAt all points along the surface, the electric field has the same magnitude:E=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{R^2}\n\nas given by Coulomb’s law for a point charge. Although the vector \\vec E changes direction everywhere along the surface, it always makes the same angle (\\SI{-180}{\\degree}) with the corresponding vector d\\vec A at any particular location. Indeed, for a point charge, the electric field points in the radial direction (inwards for a negative charge) and is thus perpendicular to the spherical surface at all points. Since the surface is closed, the vector d\\vec A points outwards anywhere on the surface. Thus, at any point on the surface, we can evaluate the flux through an infinitesimal area element, d\\vec A:d\\Phi_E=\\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=EdA\\cos(-180\\degree)=-EdA\n\nwhere the overall minus sign comes from the fact that \\vec E and d\\vec A are anti-parallel. The total flux through the spherical surface is obtained by summing together the fluxes through each area element:\\Phi_E=\\oint d\\Phi_E=\\oint -EdA=-E\\oint dA=-E(4\\pi R^2)\n\nwhere we factored E out of the integral, since the magnitude of the electric field is constant over the entire surface (a constant distance R from the charge). In the last equality, we recognized that, \\oint dA, simply means “sum together all of the areas, dA, of the surface elements”, which gives the total surface area of the sphere, 4\\pi R^2. The flux through the spherical surface is negative, because the charge is negative, and the field lines point towards -Q.\n\nUsing the value that we obtained for the magnitude of the electric field from Coulomb’s Law, the total flux is given by:\\Phi_E=-E(4\\pi R^2)=-\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{R^2}(4\\pi R^2)=-\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_0}\n\nwhich, surprisingly, is independent of the radius of the spherical surface. Note that we used \\epsilon_0 instead of Coulomb’s constant, k, since the result is cleaner without the extra factor of 4\\pi.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we calculated the flux of the electric field from a negative point charge through a spherical surface concentric with the charge. We found the flux to be negative, which makes sense, since the field lines go towards a negative charge, and there is thus a net number of field lines entering the spherical surface. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that the total flux through the surface does not depend on the radius of the surface! In fact, that statement is precisely Gauss’ law: the net flux out of a closed surface depends only on the amount of charge enclosed by that surface (and the constant, \\epsilon_0). Gauss’ law is of course more general, and applies to surfaces of any shape, as well as charges of any shape (whereas Coulomb’s Law only holds for point charges).","type":"content","url":"/gauss#sec-gauss-closedsurfaces","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Gauss’ Law"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gauss#gauss-law","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Gauss’ Law"},"content":"Gauss’ law is a relation between the net flux through a closed surface and the amount of charge, Q^{enc}, in the volume enclosed by that surface:\\boxed{\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}}\n\nIn particular, note that Gauss’ law holds true for any closed surface, and the shape of that surface is not specified in Gauss’ law.  That is, we can always choose the surface to use when calculating the flux. For obvious reasons, we often call the surface that we choose a “Gaussian surface”. But again, this surface is simply a mathematical tool, there is no actual property that makes a surface “Gaussian”; it simply means that we chose that surface in order to apply Gauss’ law.  In \n\nExample 16.3 above, we confirmed that Gauss’ law is compatible with Coulomb’s Law for the case of a point charge and a spherical Gaussian surface.\n\nPhysically, Gauss’ law is a statement that field lines must begin or end on a charge (electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges). Recall, flux is a measure of the net number of lines coming out of a surface. If there is a net number of lines coming out of a closed surface (a positive flux), that surface must enclose a positive charge from where those field lines originate. Similarly, if there are the same number of field lines entering a closed surface as there are lines exiting that surface (a flux of zero), then the surface encloses no charge. Gauss’ law simply states that the number of field lines exiting a closed surface is proportional to the amount of charge enclosed by that surface.\n\nPrimarily, Gauss’ law is a useful tool to determine the magnitude of the electric field from a given charge, or charge distribution. We usually have to use symmetry to determine the direction of the electric field vector. In general, the integral for the flux is difficult to evaluate, and Gauss’ law can only be used analytically in cases with a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, the integral for the flux is easiest to evaluate if:\n\nThe electric field makes a constant angle with the surface. When this is the case, the scalar product can be written in terms of the cosine of the angle between \\vec E and d\\vec A, which can be taken out of the integral if it is constant:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\oint E\\cos\\theta dA=\\cos\\theta\\oint EdA\n\nIdeally, one has chosen a surface such that this angle is 0 or 180\\degree.\n\nThe electric field is constant in magnitude along the surface. When this is the case, the integral can be simplified further by factoring out E and simply becomes an integral over dA (which corresponds to the total area of the surface, A):\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\cos\\theta\\oint EdA =E\\cos\\theta\\oint dA=EA\\cos\\theta\n\nUltimately, the points above should dictate the choice of Gaussian surface so that the integral for the flux is easy to evaluate. The choice of surface will depend on the symmetry of the problem. For a point (or spherical) charge, a spherical Gaussian surface allows the flux to easily be calculated (\n\nExample 16.3). For a line of charge, as we will see, a cylindrical surface results is a good choice for the Gaussian surface. Broadly, the steps for applying Gauss’ law to determine the electric field are as follows:\n\nMake a diagram showing the charge distribution.\n\nUse symmetry arguments to determine in which way the electric field vector points.\n\nChoose a Gaussian surface that goes through the point for which you want to know the electric field. Ideally, the surface is such that the electric field is constant in magnitude and always makes the same angle with the surface, so that the flux integral is straightforward to evaluate.\n\nCalculate the flux, \\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A.\n\nCalculate the amount of charge located within the volume enclosed by the surface, Q^{enc}.\n\nApply Gauss’ law,  \\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} .\n\nExample 16.4\n\nAn insulating sphere of radius, R, contains a total charge, Q, which is uniformly distributed throughout its volume. Determine an expression for the electric field as a function of distance, r, from the centre of the sphere.\nNote that this is identical, mathematically, to the derivation that was done in \n\nSection 9.3.3 for the case of gravity.\n\nSolution\n\nWhen applying Gauss’ law,  we first need to think about symmetry in order to determine the direction of the electric field vector. We also need to think about all possible regions of space in which we need to determine the electric field. In particular, for this case, we need to determine the electric field both inside (r\\leq R) and outside (r\\geq R) of the charged sphere.\n\nFigure 6 shows the charged sphere of radius R. If we consider the direction of the electric field outside the sphere (where \\vec E_{out} is drawn), we realize that it can only point in the radial direction (towards or away from the centre of the sphere), as this is the only choice that preserves the symmetry of the sphere. Being a sphere, the charge looks the same from all angles; thus, the electric field must also look the same from all angles, otherwise, there would be a preferred orientation for the sphere. The same argument holds for the electric field vector inside the sphere (drawn as \\vec E_{in}).\n\n\n\nFigure 6:For a spherical charge distribution, the electric field inside and outside must point in the radial direction, by symmetry.\n\nWe now need to choose a Gaussian surface that will make the flux integral easy to evaluate. Ideally, we can find a surface over which the electric field makes the same angle with the surface and over which the electric field is constant in magnitude. Again, based on the symmetry of the charge distribution, it is clear that a spherical surface of radius, r, will satisfy these properties.\n\nWe start by applying Gauss’ law outside the charge (with r\\geq R) to determine the electric field, \\vec E_{out}. \n\nFigure 7 shows our choice of spherical Gaussian surface (labelled S) of radius, r, which is concentric with the spherical charge distribution of radius, R, and total charge, +Q.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A spherical Gaussian surface to determine the electric field outside of a sphere of radius, R, holding charge, +Q.\n\nIn order to apply Gauss’ law,  we need to calculate:\n\nthe net flux through the surface.\n\nthe charge in the volume enclosed by the surface.\n\nThe net flux through the surface is found in the same way as in \n\nExample 16.3, and is given by:\\Phi_E&=\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\oint E dA= E\\oint dA=E(4\\pi r^2)\n\nwhere our choice of spherical surface led to \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=EdA, since \\vec E and d\\vec A are always parallel. Furthermore, by symmetry, the electric field must be constant in magnitude along the whole surface, or the spherical symmetry would be broken. This allowed us to factor the E out of the integral, leaving us with, \\oint dA, which is simply the area of our Gaussian spherical surface, 4\\pi r^2.\n\nThe Gaussian surface with r\\geq R encloses the whole charged sphere, so the charge enclosed is simply the charge of the sphere, Q^{enc}=Q. Applying Gauss’ law allows us to determine the magnitude of the electric field:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A&=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\nE(4\\pi r^2) &= \\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore E&= \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{r^2}\n\nwhich is the same as the electric field a distance r from a point charge. Thus, from the outside, a spherical charge distribution leads to the same electric field as if the charge were concentrated at the centre of the sphere.\n\nNext, we determine the magnitude of the electric field inside the charged sphere. In this case, we choose a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r\\leq R, that is concentric with the sphere, as illustrated by the surface labelled, S, that is shown in \n\nFigure 8.\n\n\n\nFigure 8:A spherical Gaussian surface to determine the electric field inside of a sphere of radius, R, holding charge, +Q.\n\nThe flux integral is trivial again, since the electric field always makes the same angle with the Gaussian surface, and the magnitude of the electric field is constant in magnitude along the surface:\\Phi_E&=\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\oint E dA= E\\oint dA=E(4\\pi r^2)\n\nIn this case, however, the charge in the volume enclosed by the Gaussian surface is less than Q, since the whole charge is not enclosed. We are told that the charge is distributed uniformly throughout the spherical volume of radius R. We can thus define a volume charge density, ρ, (charge per unit volume) for the sphere:\\rho=\\frac{Q}{V}=\\frac{Q}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3}\n\nThe volume enclosed by the Gaussian surface is \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3, thus the charge, Q^{enc}, contained in that volume is given by:Q^{enc}=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\rho=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\frac{Q}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3}=Q\\frac{r^3}{R^3}\n\nFinally, we apply Gauss’ law to find the magnitude of the electric field inside the sphere:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A&=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\nE(4\\pi r^2) &=\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_0}\\frac{r^3}{R^3}\\\\\n\\therefore E&= \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0R^3}r\n\nNote that the electric field increases linearly with radius inside of the charged sphere, and then decreases with radius squared outside of the sphere. Also, note that at the centre of the sphere, the electric field has a magnitude of zero, as expected from symmetry.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we showed how to use Gauss’ law to determine the electric field inside and outside of a uniformly charged sphere. We recognized the spherical symmetry of the charge distribution and chose to use a spherical surface in order to apply Gauss’ law.  This, in turn, allowed the flux to be easily calculated. We found that outside the sphere, the electric field decreases in magnitude with radius squared, just as if the entire charge were concentrated at the centre of the sphere. Inside the sphere, we found that the electric field is zero at the centre, and increases linearly with radius.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nIn \n\nChapter 9.1, I provided an analogy to explain Gauss’ law for gravity. If that analogy worked for you, I recommend you revisit it, as the same principles apply here. I’m now going to describe another way to think about Gauss’ law that will be useful as you become more familiar with field lines.\n\nFigure 9 shows the field lines coming from a positively charged sphere, like the one in \n\nExample 16.4.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:The field lines for a positively charged sphere.\n\nLet’s see what happens when we put a spherical Gaussian surface around the charged sphere. \n\nFigure 10 shows two surfaces of different sizes.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Two Gaussian surfaces with different radii around a charged sphere.\n\nTo make it a bit clearer, I’ll now take the charge out of the image (\n\nFigure 11), and use dots to show where the field lines passed through each surface.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:The Gaussian surfaces from \n\nFigure 10, where the dots show where the field lines passed through each surface.\n\nGauss’ law tells us that, because each surface enclosed the same amount of charge, the same number of field lines will pass through each surface. Therefore, these spheres should have the same number of dots on them. The difference between them is the density of the dots. We have learned that the closer the field lines are to each other, the stronger the electric field is. So, if we wanted to know the magnitude of the electric field at some point on one of these surfaces, we would calculate the number field lines passing through it, and then divide by the area of the sphere to get the density of the field lines.\n\nLet’s revisit the equation for Gauss’ law,\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\n\nThe right hand side gives us the number of field lines (the flux). If we can construct a surface so that the field lines passing through it are evenly distributed (and they are perpendicular to the surface), the left hand side becomes \\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A= EA. To solve for the electric field, we write E=Q^{enc}/(\\epsilon_0A), which is effectively saying that the electric field is equal to the number of field lines divided by the area of the surface.\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nFigure 12:A charged spherical shell with a cubic device inside of it.\n\nA thin charged spherical shell carries a uniformly distributed charge of +Q. If we place a cube inside the shell, as shown in \n\nFigure 12, what is the total flux out of the surface of the cube?\n\n\\frac{Q}{12\\pi}{\\rm Vm}.\n\n\\frac{Q}{2\\pi} {\\rm Vm}.\n\n\\frac{Q}{6} {\\rm Vm}.\n\n0 {\\rm Vm}.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nExample 16.5\n\nAn infinitely long straight wire carries a uniform charge per unit length, λ. What is the electric field at a distance, R, from the wire?}\nThe first thing we want to do is determine the direction of the electric field vector. We start by making a diagram of the charge distribution, as in \n\nFigure 13. To choose the direction, we can use symmetry arguments. In this case,  our choice of field direction must preserve rotational symmetry. This means that if we are in the plane perpendicular to the wire (i.e. the side view in \n\nFigure 13), the electric field should look the same from all directions (e.g. it shouldn’t matter if we look at it from the left side or the right side). With this in mind, there are three options for the electric field. It could be either:\n\nin the radial direction (point to/from the centre of the wire).\n\nsuch that electric field lines form concentric circles with the wire.\n\nco-linear with the wire.\n\nSolution\n\nIn all three possibilities above, you would not be able to infer that one particular direction in the plane perpendicular to the wire is preferred. All three possibilities preserve the rotational symmetry of the wire (the wire looks the same from all directions in the plane perpendicular to the wire).\n\nWe expect that a a negative charge would be attracted to the wire, so the electric field should have at least some radial component. We can thus eliminate the second and third options. The electric field will must then look like that illustrated in \n\nFigure 13.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:An infinite line of charge carrying uniform charge per unit length, λ. The left panel shows a side view and the right panel a view from above. The electric field must be in the radial direction or there would be a preferred direction.\n\nNext, we need to choose a Gaussian surface in order to apply Gauss’ law. A convenient choice is a cylinder (a “pill box”) of radius R and length L, as shown in \n\nFigure 14, as this goes through a point that is a distance R from the wire (where we are asked for the electric field). At all points on the cylindrical surface, the electric field vector is either perpendicular or parallel to the surface.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:A cylindrical Gaussian surface is used to calculate the flux from an infinite line of charge.\n\nWe can think of the cylindrical surface as being composed of three surfaces: two disks on either end (the lids of the pill box), and the curved surface that makes up the side of the cylinder. The flux through the entire cylindrical surface will be the sum of the fluxes through the two lids plus the flux through the side:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A = \\int_{side} \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A + \\int_{lid}\\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A + \\int_{lid}\\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A\n\nwhere you should note that the closed integral (\\oint) was separated into three normal integrals (\\int) corresponding to the three “open” surfaces that make up the closed surface. Again, remember that the flux is proportional to the net number of field lines exiting/entering the closed surface, so it makes sense to count those lines over the three open surfaces and add them together to get the total number for the closed surface.\n\nThe flux through the lids is identically zero, since the electric field is perpendicular to d\\vec A everywhere on the lids. The total flux is therefore equal to the flux through the curved side surface, for which the electric field vector is always parallel to d\\vec A, and for which the electric field vector is constant in magnitude:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A = \\int_{side} \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A =\\int_{side} EdA=E\\int_{side}dA=E(2\\pi R L)\n\nwhere we recognized that the side surface can be unfolded into a rectangle of height L and width 2\\pi R, corresponding to the circumference of the cylinder, so that the area of the side of the cylinder is given by A=2\\pi R L.\n\nNext, we determine the charge inside the volume enclosed by the surface. Since the cylinder encloses a length L of wire, the enclosed charge is given by:Q^{enc}=\\lambda L\n\nwhere λ is the charge per unit length on the wire. Putting this all together into Gauss’ law gives us the electric field at a distance R from the wire:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A&=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\nE(2\\pi R L) &= \\frac{\\lambda L}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore E&= \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0R}\n\nNote that this is the same result that we obtained in \n\nExample 15.5, when we took the limit of the finite line of charge having infinite length.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we applied Gauss’ law to determine the electric field at a distance from an infinitely long charged wire. We used symmetry to argue that the field should be radial and in the plane perpendicular to the wire, and recognized that a cylindrical Gaussian surface would exploit the symmetry so that the flux can easily be calculated. We obtained the same result as we did from integrating Coulomb’s Law in \n\nExample 15.5. However, using Gauss’ law was much less work than integrating Coulomb’s Law.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhy is it difficult to apply Gauss’ law to a finite wire?\n\nIt is easy to apply Gauss’ law to a finite wire.\n\nBecause the flux of a finite wire is undefined.\n\nBecause we do not know the charge density of a finite wire.\n\nBecause the symmetry argument does not hold.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nJosh’s Thoughts\n\nGauss’ law requires us to choose a “Gaussian” surface, but which surface should we choose? Generally, it is useful to choose a surface such that the flux can easily be determined, ideally without having to actually do an integral. If symmetry can be exploited such that \\vec E has a constant magnitude and direction relative to d\\vec A at every location of the Gaussian surface, then \\int \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec A will be equal to E A. This is why Gaussian surfaces are often of the same shape as the charged object they are enclosing.\n\nFor example, if I need to enclose a cylindrical charge, it would be reasonable to enclose the charge with a cylindrical Gaussian surface, as shown in \n\nFigure 15\n\n\n\nFigure 15:A cylindrical Gaussian surface to enclose a cylindrical charge.\n\nWhen dealing with point charges which have no shape and are thus spherically symmetric, it makes sense to choose a spherical Gaussian surface, as shown in \n\nFigure 16, since the electric field is in the radial direction for a point charge.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:. A spherical Gaussian surface to enclose a point charge.\n\nFinally, there are some cases of less than ideal choices for the Gaussian surfaces. While never wrong, they may require rather complicated integrals to determine the flux. These cases will still provide a correct answer if the situation is modelled correctly.\n\nSuppose that I enclose a spherical charge with a cylindrical Gaussian surface, as shown in \n\nFigure 17. The electric field will be stronger near the middle of the cylinder’s length than at the centre of its end caps, which means that \\vec E is not constant in \\int \\vec E \\cdot d \\vec A, so the integral cannot be simplified to EA. A better choice for a Gaussian surface in this case would be a sphere, which exploits the symmetry of the charge distribution and results in a \\vec E of constant magnitude everywhere along the surface. \n\nFigure 2 and \n\nFigure 3 give other examples of when we cannot assume Φ to be equal to EA.\n\n\n\nFigure 17:. A cylindrical surface is not a good choice to enclose a spherical charge.\n\nExample 16.6\n\nDetermine the electric field above an infinitely large plane of charge with uniform surface charge per unit area, σ.\n\nSolution\n\nFigure 18 shows a portion of the infinite plane. The electric field vector must be perpendicular to the plane or a preferred direction could otherwise be inferred from the direction of the electric field. We can also argue that the horizontal components of the electric field will cancel everywhere above the plane, since the plane is infinite. The electric field will point away from the plane if the charge is positive, and towards the plane if the charge is negative.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:The electric field above an infinite plane with uniform charge per unit area, σ, must be perpendicular to the plane.\n\nA cylindrical or box-shaped Gaussian surface would both lead to the flux integral being easy to calculate, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 19. Indeed, since the electric field is perpendicular to the plane, only the parts of the surface that are parallel to the plane (the lids on the cylinder, the two horizontal planes in the box) will have a net flux through them.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:A cylindrical surface or a box are both good choices for a Gaussian surface above a plane, since only the parts of the surface parallel to the plane will have net flux through them.\n\nLet us choose a box (right panel of \n\nFigure 19) of length, L, with a square cross-section of side, a. We place the box such that the plane intersects the centre of the box (although this is not required, since we already know that the electric field will not depend on distance from the plane). The flux through the box is simply the flux through the two horizontal planes (of area a^2):\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A&= \\int_{top} EdA+\\int_{bottom}EdA=2Ea^2\n\nThe box encloses a section of the plane with area a^2, so that the net charge enclosed by the surface is:Q^{enc}=\\sigma a^2\n\nApplying Gauss’ law allows us to determine the magnitude of the electric field:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A&=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\n2Ea^2&= \\frac{\\sigma a^2}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore E&= \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}\n\nwhich is the same result that we found in \n\nExample 15.6.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we used Gauss’ law to determine the electric field above an infinite plane. We found that we had a choice of Gaussian surfaces (cylinder, box) that allowed us to apply Gauss’ law. We found the same result that we had found in \n\nExample 15.6 where we had integrated Coulomb’s Law (twice, once for a ring of charge, then for a disk, then took the limit of the disk radius going to infinity). Again, we see that in configurations with a high degree symmetry, Gauss’ law can be very straightforward to apply.","type":"content","url":"/gauss#gauss-law","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Charges in a conductor"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gauss#sec-gauss-conductors","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Charges in a conductor"},"content":"We can use Gauss’ law to understand how charges arrange themselves on a conductor. Consider an infinite plane that carries a total charge per unit area, σ, similar to what we considered in \n\nExample 16.6. In this case, we explicitly consider the plane to be a conductor and to have a finite thickness. If we zoom into the plane, we can illustrate that the charges are located on the surface of the plane, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 20, where the plane is seen edge on. Thus, the charge density at the surface is half of the total charge density of the plane.\n\n\n\nFigure 20:Cross-section of a conducting plane where the charges migrate to the surface. A box-shaped Gaussian surface is also shown as seen from the side (the third dimension of the box is perpendicular to the plane of the page).\n\nTo determine the electric field near the plane, we choose a Gaussian surface that is a box (as in \n\nExample 16.6), but require the lower end of the box to go through the plane, as illustrated in \n\nExample 16.6. With this choice of Gaussian surface, only the top surface (area a^2) will have flux through it, since the electric field inside a conductor must be zero.

When a charge, +Q, is placed at the centre of the shell (right panel), charges inside the shell will move until the field inside the conducting material of the shell is identically zero. The negative charges will move towards the inner surface (as they are attracted to +Q) and positive charges will be repelled onto the outer surface, under the influence of the electric field created by +Q (shown in the diagram as \\vec E_{Q}). Eventually, the separation of charges will lead to an electric field (shown in the diagram as \\vec E_{\\sigma}) in the opposite direction. The charges will stop moving once the total electric field in the conductor is zero (when the two fields cancel exactly everywhere in the conductor).\n\n\n\nFigure 21:Left: a neutral conducting spherical shell (seen edge on). Right: A positive charge, +Q, placed at the centre of the shell. Charges in the shell will separate in order to keep the electric field inside the conductor zero.\n\nWe can use Gauss’ law to determine the amount of charge that has accumulated on the inner surface. Consider the Gaussian spherical surface, S_1, in \n\nFigure 21, that is concentric with the shell and has a radius such that the surface is just inside the shell. Since the electric field is zero inside the shell, the flux out of the Gaussian surface must be zero. By Gauss’ law, the amount of charge enclosed by the surface must also be zero. Thus, a total charge, -Q, will have accumulated on the inner surface of the conductor (since Q^{enc}=-Q+Q=0). Because one cannot just create charge from nothing, there must be an equal amount of opposite charge, +Q, on the outer surface of the shell. This is true of any conducting material with a cavity inside of it: if you place a charge +Q in the cavity, a charge -Q will accumulated on the inner surface and a charge +Q will accumulate on the outer surface.\n\nNow consider the flux out of the surface S_2, which is outside of the shell. The net charge enclosed will be Q^{enc}=+Q-Q+Q=+Q. If we say that the radius of S_2 is r,  then the flux out of the spherical surface is given by:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A &= E(4\\pi r^2)\\\\\n\nand the electric field, from Gauss’ law, is simply that of a point charge, +Q:E&=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{r^2}\n\nand the shell has no effect on the field. Right at the surface of the shell (outer radius R), the surface charge density is given by:\\sigma=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi r^2}\n\nAbove, we found the electric field at the surface of a conductor that carries charge per unit area, σ, to be:E&= \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}\n\nwhich is clearly the same result that we obtained using the spherical surface, S_2:E&= \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{r^2}\n\nNote that we found the electric field using Gauss’ law only in this last case, and found it to be equal to the electric field that one obtains from Coulomb’s law. Thus, Gauss’ law only works if the field has an “inverse square law” dependence. If Gauss’ law does not provide the correct electric field, then the force does not depend on 1/r^2. Gauss’ law can be used to make extremely stringent tests of whether the force goes as 1/r^2 or deviates from this model.","type":"content","url":"/gauss#sec-gauss-conductors","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Interpretation of Gauss’ law and vector calculus"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gauss#sec-gauss-interpretation","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Interpretation of Gauss’ law and vector calculus"},"content":"In this section, we provide a little more theoretical background and intuition on Gauss’ law, as well as its connection to vector calculus (which is beyond the scope of this textbook, but interesting to have a feeling for). Very generally, Gauss’ law is a statement that connects a property of a vector field to the “source” of that field. We think of mass as the source for the gravitational field, and we think of charge as the source for the electric field. The property of the field that we considered in this case was its “flux out of a closed surface”.\n\nRecall that determining the flux of a field out of a closed surface is equivalent to counting the net number of field lines that exit that closed surface. Field lines must start on a positive charge and must end on a negative charge. Thus, if there is a net number of field lines exiting the surface, there must be a positive charge in the volume defined by the surface (a “source” of field lines). If there is a net number of field lines entering the surface, then the volume defined by the surface must enclose a negative charge (a “sink” of field lines). Gauss’ law is simply a statement that the number of field lines entering/exiting a closed surface is proportional to the amount of charge enclosed in that volume.\n\nThe flux out of a closed surface is tightly connected to the vector calculus concept of “divergence”, which describes whether field lines are diverging (spreading out or getting closer together). When a point charge is present, field lines will emanate radially from that point charge; in other words, they will diverge. We say that the electric field has non-zero divergence if there is a source of the electric field in that position of space. The key difference between the concept of divergence and that of “flux out of a closed surface”, is that divergence is a local property of the field (it is true at a point), whereas the flux out of a surface must be calculated using a finite volume and makes it challenging to define the field at a specific position. Gauss’ law defined using flux is thus not as useful for describing how the field changes at specific positions, and is usually limited to situations with a high degree of symmetry.\n\nThe divergence, \\nabla \\cdot \\vec E, of a vector field, \\vec E, at some position is defined as:\\nabla \\cdot \\vec E=\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial z}\n\nand corresponds to the sum of three partial derivatives evaluated at that position in space. Gauss’ theorem (also called the divergence theorem) states that:\\int_V \\nabla \\cdot \\vec E = \\oint_S \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec A\n\nwhere the subscript on the integral indicates whether the sum (integral) should be carried out over a volume, V, or over a closed surface, S, as we have practised in this chapter. While it is not important at this level to understand the theorem in detail, the point is that one can convert a “flux over a closed surface” into an integral of the divergence of the field. In other words, we can convert a global property (flux) to a local property (divergence). Gauss’ law in terms of divergence can be written as:\\boxed{\\nabla \\cdot \\vec E = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}}\\quad \\text{(Local version of Gauss' law)}\n\nwhere ρ is the charge per unit volume at a specific position in space. This is the version of Gauss’ law that is usually seen in advanced textbooks and in Maxwell’s unified theory of electromagnetism. This version of Gauss’ law relates a local property of the field (its divergence) to a local property of charge at that position in space (the charge per unit volume at that position in space). If we integrate both sides of the equation over volume, we recover the original formulation of Gauss’ law: the left hand side, by the divergence theorem, leads to flux when integrated over volume, whereas on the right hand side, the integral over volume of charge per unit volume, ρ, will give the total charge enclosed in that volume, Q^{enc}:\\int_V  \\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec E \\right)dV&= \\int_V \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) dV\\\\\n\\oint_S \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec A &=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}","type":"content","url":"/gauss#sec-gauss-interpretation","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gauss#summary","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 16 - Gauss' Law","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"We can define the flux of a uniform and constant vector field, \\vec E, through a flat surface, as:\\Phi_E = \\vec E \\cdot \\vec A = EA\\cos\\theta\n\nwhere \\vec A is a vector that is perpendicular to the surface with a magnitude equal to the area of that surface, and, θ, is the angle between \\vec A and \\vec E.\n\nThe flux of a field through a surface is proportional to the number of field lines that cross that surface. If the surface is parallel to the field (\\vec A and \\vec E are thus perpendicular), the flux through that surface is zero (no field lines cross the surface, the scalar product is zero). If \\vec E and \\vec A change over the surface (\\vec E and/or \\vec A change magnitude and/or direction relative to each other along the surface), then we treat the surface as being made of infinitesimal surface elements over which the two vectors are constant. We define a vector d\\vec A to be perpendicular to the surface element with an infinitesimal area, dA. The total flux is then obtained by summing the fluxes through each surface element:\\Phi_E=\\int \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec A=\\int EdA\\cos\\theta\n\nNote that the direction of the vector d\\vec A (or \\vec A) is ambiguous, as one can choose either of two directions perpendicular to a surface. Usually, one chooses the direction of \\vec A so that the flux is positive (i.e. \\vec A has a component parallel to \\vec E). However, if the surface is “closed” (that is, it defines a volume), then we always choose the direction of d\\vec A so that it points outwards from the surface (since the surface encloses a volume, one can define an “inside” and an “outside”).\n\nIn the case of the electric field, Gauss’ law relates the flux of the electric field from a closed surface to the amount of charge, Q^{enc}, contained in the volume enclosed by that surface:\\oint \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec A = \\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\n\nPhysically, Gauss’ law is a statement that field lines must begin or end on a charge (electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges). If there is a net number of lines coming out of a closed surface (a positive flux), that surface must enclose a positive charge from where those field lines originate. Similarly, if there are the same number of field lines entering a closed surface as there are lines exiting that surface (a flux of zero), then the surface encloses no charge. Gauss’ law states that the number of field lines exiting a closed surface is proportional to the amount of charge enclosed by that surface.\n\nGauss’ law is useful to determine the electric field. However, this can only be done analytically for charge distributions with a very high degree of symmetry. This is because the flux integral is not usually easy to evaluate unless:\n\nThe electric field makes a constant angle with the surface. When this is the case, the scalar product can be written in terms of the cosine of the angle between \\vec E and d\\vec A, which can be taken out of the integral if it is constant:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\oint E\\cos\\theta dA=\\cos\\theta\\oint EdA\n\nThe electric field is constant in magnitude along the surface. When this is the case, the integral can be simplified further by factor out E, and simply becomes an integral over dA (which corresponds to the total area of the surface, A):\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\cos\\theta\\oint EdA =E\\cos\\theta\\oint dA=EA\\cos\\theta\n\nNote that Gauss’ law does not specify a closed surface over which to calculate the flux; it holds for any surface. We can thus choose a surface that will make the flux integral easy to evaluate - we call this choice a “Gaussian surface” (not because it has some special property, but because we chose that surface to apply Gauss’ law). A procedure for applying Gauss’ law to determine the electric field at some point in space can be written as:\n\nMake a diagram showing the charge distribution.\n\nUse symmetry arguments to determine in which way the electric field vector points.\n\nChoose a Gaussian surface that goes through the point for which you want to know the electric field. Ideally, the surface is such that the electric field is constant in magnitude and always makes the same angle with the surface, so that the flux integral is straightforward to evaluate.\n\nCalculate the flux, \\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A.\n\nCalculate the amount of charge in the volume enclosed by the surface, Q^{enc}.\n\nApply Gauss’ law, \\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} .\n\nWe showed how Gauss’ law can be used to understand and quantify how charges arrange themselves on a conductor, in such a way that the electric field is zero everywhere in the conductor. Finally, we briefly introduced a more modern version of Gauss’ law that uses divergence instead of flux:\\nabla \\cdot \\vec E &= \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\n\nThis last version has the advantage that it relates a local property of the field (divergence) to a local property of charge (charge density at some position in space).\n\nImportant Equations\n\nGauss’ Law:\\Phi & = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\Phi &= \\int \\vec E \\cdot d \\vec A\n\nImportant Definitions\n\nElectric flux: A measure of the number of electric field lines crossing a surface.

In order to determine the total charge of the sphere, we divide the sphere into shells of radius r and infinitesimal thickness dr.

To find the surface charge density on the inner surface, we draw a cylindrical Gaussian surface, S_1, whose cross-sectional radius is slightly larger than R, as in \n\nFigure 23.

For the outer surface, we consider a Gaussian surface with a triangular cross section, S_2.

Since the work done by the electric force only depends on the location of the initial (A) and final (B) positions, we can define an electrical potential energy function, U(\\vec r), that depends on position, \\vec r.

The energy that was originally stored in this “system” of two charges is called “electrostatic potential energy”. In this section, we show how to model the energy stored in a collection of point charges.\n\nConsider a single positive charge, q_1, located at the origin of empty space. Since there are no other charges present, it does not “cost” us any energy to place that charge there - we do not need to do any work. If we now bring in a second positive charge, q_2, and place it a distance, r_{12}, from q_1 (\n\nFigure 2), we will need to do work since q_1 exerts a force on q_2.

Similarly, a negative charge, q=-1 {\\rm C}, will have negative potential energy, U=-10 {\\rm J}, at the same location.\n\nSince only differences in potential energy are physically meaningful, only changes in electrical potential are physically meaningful. A difference in electric potential is commonly called a “voltage”. One often makes a clear choice of where the electric potential is zero (typically the ground, or infinitely far away), so that the term voltage is used to describe potential, V, instead of difference in potential, \\Delta V; this should only be done when it is clear where the location of zero electric potential is defined.\n\nWe can describe a free-falling mass by stating that the mass moves from a region where it has high gravitational potential energy to a region of lower gravitational potential energy under the influence of gravity (the force associated with a potential energy always acts in the direction to decreases potential energy). The same is true for electrical potential energy: charges will always experience a force in a direction to decrease their electrical potential energy. However, positive charges will experience a force driving them from regions of high electric potential to regions of low electric potential, whereas negative charges will experience a force driving them from regions of low electric potential to regions of higher electric potential. This is because, for negative charges, the change in potential energy associated with moving through space, \\Delta U, will be the negative of the corresponding change in electric potential, \\Delta U=q\\Delta V, since the charge, q, is negative.TODO: kind of confusing\n\nCheckpoint\n\nElectric potential increases along the x axis. A proton and an electron are placed at rest at the origin; in which direction do the charges move when released?}\n\nthe proton moves towards negative x, while the electron moves towards positive x.\n\nthe proton moves towards positive x, while the electron moves towards negative x.\n\nthe proton and electron move towards negative x.\n\nthe proton and electron move towards positive x.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nIf the only force exerted on a particle is the electric force, and the particle moves in space such that the electric potential changes by \\Delta V, we can use conservation of energy to determine the corresponding change in kinetic energy of the particle:\\Delta E &= \\Delta U + \\Delta K = 0\\\\\n\\Delta U &= q\\Delta V\\\\\\boxed{\\therefore \\Delta K = -q \\Delta V}\n\nwhere \\Delta E is the change in total mechanical energy of the particle, which is zero when energy is conserved. The kinetic energy of a positive particle increases if the particle moves from a region of high potential to a region of low potential (as \\Delta V would be negative and q is positive), and vice versa for a negative particle. This makes sense, since a positive and negative particle feel forces in opposite directions.\n\nIn order to describe the energies of particles such as electrons, it is convenient to use a different unit of energy than the Joule, so that the quantities involved are not orders of magnitude smaller than 1. A common choice is the “electron volt”, eV}. One electron volt corresponds to the energy acquired by a particle with a charge of e (the charge of the electron) when it is accelerated by a potential difference of 1 {\\rm V}:\\Delta E &= q\\Delta V\\\\\n1 {\\rm eV}&=(e)(1 {\\rm V})=1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm J}\n\nAn electron that has accelerated from rest across a region with a 150 {\\rm V} potential difference across it will have a kinetic of 150 {\\rm eV}=2.4\\times 10^{-17} {\\rm J}. As you can see, it is easier to describe the energy of an electron in electron volts than Joules.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA particle moves from an electric potential of -260 {\\rm V} to an electric potential of -600 {\\rm V} and loses kinetic energy. What is the charge of this particle?\n\nNeutral.\n\nIt could have a positive or a negative charge.\n\nPositive.\n\nNegative.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nJosh’s Thoughts\n\nIt is often useful in physics to take previously learned concepts and compare them to new ones, in this case, gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy can be compared to help understand the physical meaning of electric potential.\n\nSuppose that an object with a large mass, M, is sitting in space. Now place an object of a much smaller mass, m, at any distance, r, from the centre of M. The gravitational potential energy of the small mass is given by the following formula:U_g&=\\frac{GMm}{r}\n\nWhich is very similar to the formula for electrical potential energy:U(\\vec r)&=\\frac{kQq}{r}\n\nNow, if we were to remove the mass m from its position, we would no longer have an object with gravitational potential energy. However, we could still describe the gravitational potential for the point, r, which would result in gravitational potential energy when any mass m is placed there. This is the gravitational equivalent to electric potential, and can be defined as:V_g&=\\frac{U_g}{m}\n\nwhich is also very similar to the formula for electric potential:V_E&=\\frac{U_E}{q}\n\nThis comparison is illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Gravitational potential energy and gravitational potential (left) next to its electrical analogue (right).\n\nExample 17.1\n\nA proton and an electron move from a region of space where the electric potential is 20 {\\rm V} to a region of space where the electric potential is 10 {\\rm V}. If the electric force is the only force exerted on the particles, what can you say about their change in speed?\n\nSolution\n\nThe two particles move from a region of space where the electric potential is 20 {\\rm V} to a region of space where the electric potential is 10 {\\rm V}. The change in electric potential experienced by the particles is thus:\\Delta V = V_{final}-V_{initial}=(10 {\\rm V})-(20 {\\rm V})=-10 {\\rm V}\n\nand we take the opportunity to emphasize that one should be very careful with signs when using potential. The change in potential energy of the proton, with charge q=+e, is thus:\\Delta U_p=q\\Delta V = (+e)(-10 {\\rm V})=-10 {\\rm eV}\n\nThe potential energy of the proton thus decreases by 10 {\\rm eV} (which you can easily convert to Joules). Since we are told that no other force is exerted on the particle, the total mechanical energy of the particle (kinetic plus potential energies) must be constant. Thus, if the potential energy decreased, then the kinetic energy of the proton has increased by the same amount, and the proton’s speed increases.\n\nThe change in potential energy of the electron, with charge q=-e, is thus:\\Delta U_e=q\\Delta V = (-e)(-10 {\\rm V}) = 10 {\\rm eV}\n\nThe potential energy of the electron thus increases by 10 {\\rm eV}. Again, the mechanical energy of the electron is conserved, so that an increase in potential energy results in the same decrease in kinetic energy and the electron’s speed decreases.\n\nDiscussion: By using the electric potential, V, we modelled the change in electric potential energy of a proton and an electron as they both moved from one region of space to another.\n\nWe found that when a proton moves from a region of high electric potential to a region of lower electric potential, its potential energy decreases. This is because the proton has a positive charge and a decrease in electric potential will also result in a decrease in potential energy. Since no other forces are exerted on the proton, the proton’s kinetic energy must increase. Because the potential energy of the proton decreases, the proton is moving in the same direction as the electric force, and the electric force does positive work on the proton to increase its kinetic energy.\n\nConversely, we found that when an electron moves from a region of high electric potential to a region of lower electric potential, its potential energy increases. This is because it has a negative charge and a decrease in electrical potential thus results in an increase in potential energy. Since no other forces are exerted on the electron, the electron’s kinetic energy must decrease, and the electron slows down. This makes sense, since the force that is exerted on an electron will be in the opposite direction from the force exerted on a proton.","type":"content","url":"/electricpotential#electric-potential","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl3":"Electric potential from electric field","lvl2":"Electric potential"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/electricpotential#electric-potential-from-electric-field","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl3":"Electric potential from electric field","lvl2":"Electric potential"},"content":"At the beginning of \n\nSection 17.2, we determined the potential energy of a point charge, q, in the presence of another point charge, Q (\n\nFigure 1). This was done by calculating the work done by the Coulomb (electric) force exerted by charge Q on q. We can write the same integral for the work done by the electric force on q, but using the electric field, \\vec E, to write the force:W&=\\int_A^B \\vec F^E\\cdot d\\vec r=\\int_A^B q \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r=q \\int_A^B  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r\n\nwhere we recognized that the charge, q, is constant and can come out of the integral. The integral that is left is thus the work done by the electric field, \\vec E, per unit charge. In other words, this is the negative change in electric potential:W=q \\int_A^B  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r=-q\\Delta V = -q\\left[ V(\\vec r_B)-V(\\vec r_A) \\right]\\boxed{\\therefore \\Delta V =V(\\vec r_B)-V(\\vec r_A)=-\\int_A^B  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r}\n\nwhich allows us to easily determine the change in electric potential associated with an electric field. Note that this result is general and does not require the electric field to be that of a point charge, and can be used to determine the electric potential associated with any electric field. We can also specify a function for the potential, up to an arbitrary constant, C, (think definite versus indefinite integrals):V(\\vec r)=-\\int \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r + C\n\nThe relation between electric potential and electric field is analogous to the relation between electric potential energy and electric force:\\Delta V &=V(\\vec r_B)-V(\\vec r_A)=-\\int_A^B  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r\\\\\n\\Delta U &=U(\\vec r_B)-U(\\vec r_A)=-\\int_A^B  \\vec F^E\\cdot d\\vec r\n\nas the bottom equation is just q times the first equation. We can think of electric potential being to potential energy what electric field is to electric force. Electric potential and electric field are electric potential energy and electric force, per unit charge, respectively.\n\nFor a point charge, Q, located at the origin, the electric field at some position, \\vec r, is given by Coulomb’s Law:\\vec E=\\frac{kQ}{r^2}\\hat r\n\nThe potential difference between location A (at position \\vec r_A) and location B (at position \\vec r_B), as in \n\nFigure 1, is given by:\\Delta V &=- \\int_A^B  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r= -\\int_{\\vec r_A}^{\\vec r_B}  \\frac{kQ}{r^2}\\hat r\\cdot d\\vec r=-\\left(\\frac{kQ}{r_B}-\\frac{kQ}{r_A}\\right)\n\nand we note that we can write a function for the electric potential, V(\\vec r), at a distance r from a point charge, Q, as:V(\\vec r)=\\frac{kQ}{r}+C\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant. This, of course, is identical to the result that we obtained earlier, for the potential energy of a charge, q, a distance, r, from Q:U(\\vec r)=qV(\\vec r)=\\frac{kQq}{r}+C'\n\nwhere the constant, C'=qC, does not have any physical impact. Often, as is the case for gravity, one chooses the constant C=0. This choice corresponds to defining potential energy to be zero at infinity. Equivalently, this corresponds to choosing infinity to be at an electric potential of 0 {\\rm V}.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat causes a positively charged particle to gain speed when it is accelerated through a potential difference?\n\nThe particle accelerates because it loses potential energy as it moves from high to low potential.\n\nThe particle accelerates because it loses potential energy as it moves from low to high potential\n\nThe particle accelerates because it gains potential energy.\n\nThe particle accelerates because it moves towards negative charges.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nBelow, I’ve included a grid you can use to remember how the electric field (\\vec E), electric force (\\vec F), electric potential (V), and electric potential energy (U) relate to one another.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A visual guide showing how to get one formula from another.\n\nFor example, let’s say you are given the electric field and want to find the electric potential energy for a charge q. You would start at \\vec E and follow the operations on the arrows to get to U, i.e. you would perform the line integral and then multiply by q, or vice versa.\n\nOf course, when you reverse directions (e.g. to go from U to \\vec E), you have to reverse the operations of the arrows. We will see what the reverse operation of the line integral is in \n\nSection 17.3.2. \n\nFigure 5 shows how this grid would be filled out if you were dealing with two point charges, Q and q, as we have seen so far in this chapter.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:How you would use the guide in the case of a point charge, Q, exerting a force on another point charge, q.\n\nExample 17.2\n\nWhat is the electric potential at the edge of a hydrogen atom (a distance of 1 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm A} from the proton), if one sets 0 {\\rm V} at infinity? If an electron is located at a distance of 1 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm A} from the proton, how much energy is required to remove the electron; that is, how much energy is required to ionize the hydrogen atom?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can easily calculate the electric potential, a distance of 1 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm A} from a proton, since this corresponds to the potential from a point charge (with C=0):V(\\vec r)&=\\frac{kQ}{r}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(9\\times 10^{9} {\\rm N\\cdot m^2/C^{2}})(1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm C})}{(1\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm m})}\\\\\n&=14.4 {\\rm V}\n\nWe can calculate the potential energy of the electron (relative to infinity, where the potential is 0 {\\rm V}, since we chose C=0):U&=(-e)V\\\\\n&=(-1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm C})(14.4 {\\rm V})=-14.4 {\\rm eV}\\\\\n&=-2.3\\times 10^{-18} {\\rm J}\n\nwhere we also expressed the potential energy in electron volts. In order to remove the electron from the hydrogen atom, we must exert a force (do work) until the electron is infinitely far from the proton. At infinity, the potential energy of the electron will be zero (by our choice of C=0). When moving the electron from the hydrogen atom to an infinite distance away, we must do positive work to counter the attractive force from the proton. The work that we must do is exactly equal to the change in potential energy of the electron (and equal to the negative of the work done by the force exerted by the proton):W&=\\Delta U\\\\\n&=(U_{final}-U_{initial})\\\\\n&=(0 {\\rm J}--2.3\\times 10^{-18} {\\rm J})\\\\\n&=2.3\\times 10^{-18} {\\rm J}\n\nThe positive work that we must do, exerting a force that is opposite to the electric force, is positive and equal to 2.3\\times 10^{-18} {\\rm J}, or 14.4 {\\rm eV}. If you look up the ionization energy of hydrogen, you will find that it is 13.6 {\\rm eV}, so that this very simplistic model is quite accurate (we could improve the model by adjusting the proton-electron distance so that the potential is 13.6 {\\rm V}).\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we determined the electrical potential energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom, and found that it is negative, when potential energy is defined to be zero at infinity. In order to remove the electron from the atom, we must do positive work in order to increase the potential energy of the electron from a negative value to zero (the potential energy at infinity). This is analogous to the work that must be done on a satellite in a gravitationally bound orbit for it to reach escape velocity.\n\nExample 17.3\n\nTwo large parallel plates are separated by a distance, L. The plates are oppositely charged and carry the same magnitude of charge per unit area, σ. What is the potential difference between the two plates? Write an expression for the electric potential in the region between the two plates. Assume that the plates are large enough that you can treat them as infinite (that is, neglect what happens near the edges).\n\nSolution\n\nFigure 6 shows a diagram of the two parallel plates with surface charge on them.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Two parallel plates with equal and opposite surface charge densities. In the region between the plates, the electric field is uniform.\n\nWe know from the previous chapters that the electric field from the positive plate does not depend on distance from the plate and is given by:\\vec E_+=-\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0} \\hat x\n\nif we approximate the plate as being infinitely large. This is a reasonable approximation for most points except those near the edges of the plate, which we ignore. The electric field from the negative plate will have the same magnitude and direction, so that the total electric field, \\vec E, everywhere between the two parallel plates (as long as we are not near the edges) is given by:\\vec E=-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0} \\hat x\n\nNote that the electric field outside the region between the two plates is zero everywhere, as the field from the positive and negative plates point in opposite directions outside the plates and thus cancel (except near the edges of the plates). For example, below the negative plate, the field from the negative plate points in the positive x direction (towards the negative plate), whereas the field from the positive plate points in the negative x direction (away from the positive plate).\n\nWe can now determine the potential difference between the two plates, since we know the electric field in that region. Using the coordinate system that is shown, we calculate the potential difference between the positive plate located at x=L and the negative plate located at x=0:\\Delta V &=V(L)-V(0)\\\\\n&=- \\int_0^L  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec x\\\\\n&=-\\int_0^L\\frac{-\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0} \\hat x \\cdot d\\vec x\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}\\int_0^L dx\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}L\n\nwhere we recognized that \\hat x and d\\vec x are parallel. It is very easy to get the wrong sign when calculating potential differences, so be careful!\n\nSince the potential difference, \\Delta V=V(L)-V(0), is positive, the plate at x=L is at a higher electric potential than the plate at x=0. This makes sense, as a positive charge at rest would move from the positive plate to the negative plate, thus decreasing its potential energy, which corresponds to moving from a region of high electric potential to a region of low electric potential. Conversely, a negative charge at rest would move from the negative plate to the positive plate, decreasing its potential energy, but moving from a region of low electric potential to a region of high electric potential.\n\nIn general, if the electric field is constant, the change in potential between two points separated by a distance, L, along an axis that is anti-parallel with the field (in this example, the field points in the negative x direction) is given by:\\Delta V &=- \\int_0^L  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec x\\\\\n&=E\\int_0^L dx\\\\\n&= EL\n\nNote that we can only calculate the difference in electric potential between plates, not the actual value of the potential, V. If we want to define a specific value of electric potential, we need to choose a location where we define 0 {\\rm V} to be. By convention, when possible, one chooses the negative plate to be the location of 0 {\\rm V}. In order to determine the electric potential anywhere between the two plates, we can calculate the potential difference between the plate at x=0 (the one at 0 {\\rm V}) and some position between the plates along the x axis (x<L):\\Delta V &=V(x)-V(0)\\\\\n&=-\\int_0^x E \\hat x \\cdot d\\vec x\\\\\n&= Ex \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}x\\\\\n\\therefore V(x)&=V(0)+Ex\\\\\n&=Ex\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}x\n\nwhere we find that the electric potential increases linearly between its value at the negative plate (0 {\\rm V}) and its value at the positive plate (EL). Of course, we could have chosen any value of the electric potential for the negative plate, which is equivalent to choosing the value of the arbitrary constant, C.\n\nIn general, we can write the electric potential in a region of constant electric field, \\vec E=-E\\hat x, as:V(x)=Ex + C\n\nThis scenario is very similar to the gravitational force near the surface of the Earth, where the gravitational field is (almost) constant. If you choose to define zero gravitational potential energy at the surface of the Earth then, as you move up a distance h from the ground, your gravitational potential energy increases linearly with h (U(h)=mgh). In our case, we defined zero electrical potential energy to correspond to the location of the negative plate (the negative plate is thus like the surface of the Earth, with a constant electric field pointing towards it). As a positive charge moves a distance h away from the negative plate, it gains electric potential energy, U(h)=qV(h)=qEh, linearly with distance from the plate. If we release that positive charge, it will “fall” back onto the negative plate. The main difference with gravity, is that we can also have negative charges, which under gravity, would be similar to “negative masses” (it’s not a thing), which would “fall upwards” (towards the positive plate).\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we examined the electric field between two parallel plates with opposite charges on them, and saw that the field is constant and uniform between the plates and zero outside (except for a small region near the edge of the plates where the assumption of infinitely large plates breaks down). We found that the electric potential decreases linearly as a function of distance from one of the plates. Because the electric field is constant between the two plates, the electric force on a charge can be treated in a similar way as the gravitational force on a mass near the surface of the Earth. The resulting electric potential is linear in the distance from the negative plate, just as mgh is linear in h, the distance to the surface of the Earth. Parallel plates are often used to accelerate charges, so they are useful to understand.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIf we defined a gravitional potential, V(h), for particles a small distance, h, from the surface of the Earth, it would have the form:\n\nV(h) = mgh + C.\n\nV(h) = gh + C.\n\nV(h) = mg + C.\n\nV(h) = -mgh + C.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/electricpotential#electric-potential-from-electric-field","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl3":"Electric field from electric potential","lvl2":"Electric potential"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/electricpotential#sec-potential-fieldfrompotential","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl3":"Electric field from electric potential","lvl2":"Electric potential"},"content":"Review\n\nSection 8.3.1 on determining force from potential energy.\n\nSection 1.3.2 on gradients.\n\nIn the previous section, we found that we could determine the electric potential (a scalar) from the electric field vector. In this section, we show how to do the reverse, and determine the electric field vector from the electric potential. Consider, first, a one-dimensional case, where the electric field, \\vec E(x)= E(x) \\hat x, point in the x direction and depends on position, x. In this one-dimensional case, the electric potential is obtained from the negative anti-derivative of the electric field:V(x)=-\\int \\vec E(x)\\cdot d\\vec x=-\\int E(x) dx\n\nThe electric field must then be given by the negative of the derivative of the electric potential function:\\vec E(x) = -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}\\hat x\n\nNote that we can tell from the above that the electric field must have dimensions of electric potential over distance. The most common S.I. unit used to describe the electric field is {\\rm V/m} (Volts per meter).\n\nThis result is very similar to that obtained in \n\nSection 8.3.1, where we examined how one could use the scalar potential energy, U(x,y,z), to determine the vector for the force associated with that potential energy. The same holds for the electric force, where we can determine the electric force vector, \\vec F, from the electric potential energy, and similarly the electric field from the electric potential. In three dimensions, if we know the electric potential energy as a function of position, U(\\vec r)=U(x,y,z), then the electric force vector is given by:\\vec F(x,y,z) =- \\nabla U=-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\hat x-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\hat y-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\hat z\n\nSimilarly, but using force per unit charge (i.e. electric field) and potential energy per unit charge (i.e. electric potential), we find:\\vec E(x,y,z) = -\\nabla V =-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\hat x-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\hat y-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z}\\hat z\n\nwhere, as you recall, \\nabla V, is called the gradient of the scalar field, V(x,y,z). The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of maximal increase of the value of V(x,y,z). For a positive charge, this corresponds to the direction of maximal increase in potential energy. A positive charge will experience a force in the opposite direction (in the direction where the potential energy decreases the fastest), and the electric field is thus in the opposite direction from the gradient of the electric potential.","type":"content","url":"/electricpotential#sec-potential-fieldfrompotential","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl3":"Equipotential surfaces","lvl2":"Electric potential"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/electricpotential#equipotential-surfaces","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl3":"Equipotential surfaces","lvl2":"Electric potential"},"content":"We can visualize electric potential in several ways, since it is a scalar field (it has a single value that can differ everywhere in space). \n\nFigure 7 shows the electric potential near a positive charge, +Q, where we have chosen 0 {\\rm V} to be located at infinity.

On a geographical map, contours correspond to lines of constant altitude, which are also lines of constant gravitational potential energy. Similarly, we can draw lines of constant electric potential. Lines of constant potential are called “equipotential lines”. In three dimensions, regions of constant electric potential can be surfaces or volumes, called “equipotential surfaces/volumes”.\n\nThe electric field vector is always perpendicular to equipotential lines/surfaces. At any point in space, the electric field vector points opposite to the gradient of the electric potential, since \\vec E=-\\nabla V. This means that the electric field points in the direction where the potential decreases the fastest, which must be perpendicular to the direction where the potential stays the same (i.e. the equipotential lines). Another way to think about this is to consider a charge moving along an equipotential. By definition, the electric potential energy of the charge does not change if its moves along an equipotential. As a result, the electric force/field cannot do any work on the charge, and so must be perpendicular to the path of the charge.\n\nIn order to draw equipotential lines, you can start by drawing electric field lines, and then draw (closed) contour lines that are everywhere perpendicular to the electric field lines.

We modelled the ring as being made of many infinitesimal point charges, and summed together the infinitesimal electric potentials from those charges relative to infinity. This was much simpler than determining the electric field, since electric potential is a scalar and we do not need to consider how the components from different dq along the ring will cancel.\n\nExample 17.5\n\nA long, thin, straight wire carries uniform charge per unit length, λ. The electric potential difference between points located at distances r_B=2 {\\rm cm} and r_A=1 {\\rm cm} from the wire is found to be V(r_B)-V(r_A)=-100 {\\rm V}. What is the linear charge density on wire, λ?\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A long thin wire with measurements of electric potential at varying points.\n\nSolution\n\nIn this case, we can use Gauss’ Law to determine the electric field at a certain distance from the wire. From that, we can calculate the electric potential difference between any two points near the wire, and thus the charge density on the wire.\n\nBy using a cylindrical surface of length, L, and radius, r, we can use Gauss’ Law to determine the field at a distance, r, from the wire:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec A&=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n2\\pi r L E&= \\frac{\\lambda L}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec E(r)&=\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}\\hat r\n\nUsing the electric field, we can calculate the potential difference between two points that are at distances, r_A and r_B, from the wire:\\Delta V &=V(r_B)-V(r_A)\\\\\n&=-\\int_{r_A}^{r_B}  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r\\\\\n&=-\\int_{r_A}^{r_B}  \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}\\hat r \\right)\\cdot d\\vec r\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\int_{r_A}^{r_B}   \\frac{1}{r}\\hat r \\cdot d\\vec r\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\int_{r_A}^{r_B}   \\frac{1}{r}dr\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\left[|\\ln(r)|\\right]_{r_A}^{r_B} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_B}{r_A}\\right)\\\\\n\\therefore\\Delta V &=\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_A}{r_B}\\right)\n\nwhere, in the second last line, we removed the absolute value from the logarithm, since r_A<r_B, and in the last line, we removed the minus sign by inverting the argument of the logarithm. Since we know the potential difference, \\Delta V, for two points located at distances r_B=2 {\\rm cm} and r_A=1 {\\rm cm}, we can determine the charge density on the wire:\\Delta V &=V(r_B)-V(r_A)=-100 {\\rm V}\\\\\n\\Delta V &=\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_A}{r_B}\\right)\\\\\n\\therefore \\lambda &= \\frac{2\\pi\\epsilon_0\\Delta V}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_A}{r_B}\\right)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2\\pi(8.85\\times 10^{-12} {\\rm C^2\\cdot N^{-1}\\cdot m^{-2}})(-100 {\\rm V})}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}\\\\\n&=8.02\\times 10^{-9} {\\rm C/m}\n\nwhere, again, one needs to be very careful with the signs! Note that it also makes sense that the potential difference, \\Delta V =V(r_B)-V(r_A), is negative, since r_A is closer to the positively charged wire. A positive charge at rest would move away from the positively charged wire, from r_A to r_B, from high potential to low potential.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we showed how to determine the electric potential near an infinitely long charged wire by using the electric field that we determined from Gauss’ Law. By knowing the potential difference between two points near the wire, we were then able to infer the charge density on the wire.","type":"content","url":"/electricpotential#calculating-electric-potential-from-charge-distributions","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl2":"Electric field and potential at the surface of a conductor"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/electricpotential#electric-field-and-potential-at-the-surface-of-a-conductor","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl2":"Electric field and potential at the surface of a conductor"},"content":"Conducting materials are always equipotential surfaces (or volumes) if charges are not moving inside the conductor. This is because the electric field inside a conductor is always zero and thus, a charge moving through a conductor experiences no electric force and its electrical potential energy will be constant. Similarly, because the electric field must always be perpendicular to an equipotential, electric field lines are always perpendicular to the surface of a conductor (in electrostatics).\n\nIf we consider a conducting sphere of radius R and charge +Q, the electric field at the surface of the sphere is given by:E=k\\frac{Q}{R^2}\n\nas we found in \n\nChapter 16.1. If we define electric potential to be zero at infinity, then the electric potential at the surface of the sphere is given by:V=k\\frac{Q}{R}\n\nIn particular, the electric field at the surface of the sphere is related to the electric potential at its surface by:E=\\frac{V}{R}\n\nThus, if two spheres are at the same electric potential, the one with the smaller radius will have a stronger electric field at its surface.\n\nBecause a conducting sphere is symmetric, the charges will distribute themselves symmetrically around the whole outer surface of the sphere. The charge per unit area, σ, at the surface of the sphere is thus given by:\\sigma &= \\frac{Q}{4\\pi R^2}\n\nThe charge density can be related to the electric field at the surface of the sphere:E&=k\\frac{Q}{R^2}=k\\frac{4\\pi R^2\\sigma}{R^2}=4\\pi\\sigma k=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}\n\nwhere in the last equality, we used k with \\epsilon_0 and confirmed the general result from \n\nSection 16.4, where we determined the electric field near a conductor with surface charge σ.\n\nConsider a sphere of radius R_1 that carries total charge, +Q. A neutral second, smaller, conducting sphere, of radius R_2, is then connected to the first sphere, using a conducting wire, as in \n\nFigure 11.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:Two conducting spheres are connected by a conducting wire. The charge Q that was originally on the larger sphere distributes itself onto the two spheres.\n\nBecause the charges on the large sphere can move around freely, some of them will move to the smaller sphere. Very quickly, the charges will stop moving and the spheres of radius R_1 and R_2 will end up carrying charges Q_1 and Q_2, respectively (we assume that the wire is small enough that negligible amounts of charge are distributed on the wire). Since the two conducting spheres are connected by a conductor, they form an equipotential, and are thus at the same voltage, V, relative to infinity. Since the two spheres are at the same electric potential, the electric field at the surface of each sphere are related:E_1&=\\frac{V}{R_1}\\\\\nE_2&=\\frac{V}{R_2}\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{E_2}{E_1}&=\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\\\\n\\therefore E_2&=E_1\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\n\nand the electric field at the surface of the smaller sphere, E_2, is stronger since R_2<R_1. We can also compare the surface charge densities on the two spheres:E_1&=\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\nE_2&=\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1}&=\\frac{E_2}{E_1}=\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\\\\n\\therefore \\sigma_2&=\\sigma_1 \\frac{R_1}{R_2}\n\nand we find that the charge density is higher on the smaller sphere. Thus, there are more charges per unit area on the smaller sphere than the bigger sphere.\n\nWe can generalize this model to describe charges on any charged conducting object. If charges are deposited on a conducting object that is not a sphere, as in \n\nFigure 12, they will not distribute themselves uniformly. Instead, there will be a higher charge density (charges per unit area), near parts of the object that have a small radius of curvature, just as the charge density was higher on the smaller sphere described above. As a consequence of the higher concentration of charges near the “pointier” parts of the object, the electric field at the surface will be the strongest in those regions.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:On an uneven conductor, charges will accumulate on the sharper points, where the radius of curvature is the smallest.\n\nIn air, if the electric field exceeds a magnitude of approximately 3\\times 10^{6} {\\rm V/m}, the air is said to “electrically break down”. The strong electric field can remove electrons from atoms in the air, ionizing the air in a chain reaction and making it conductive. Thus, if the electric field at a point on the surface of a conductor is very strong, the air near that point will break down, and charges will leave the conductor, through the air, to find a location with lower electric potential energy (usually the ground). Electric breakdown is what we experience as a spark (or lightning, on a larger scale), and is usually a discrete (and potentially dramatic) event. Corona discharge is another mechanism whereby the strong electric field can make the air conductive, but in this case, charges leak into the air more gradually, unlike in the case of electrical break down. Charges leaking into air through Corona discharge will emit a faint blueish light (the “Corona”) as well as an audible hissing sound.\n\nObjects that are designed to hold a high electric potential (for example the electrodes on high voltage lines) are usually made very carefully so that they have a very smooth surface and no sharp edges. This reduces the risk of breakdown or Corona discharge at the surface which would result in a loss of charge.\n\nContrary to popular belief, lightning rods are not designed to attract lightening. Instead, lightning rods are designed to be conductors with a very sharp point, so that Corona discharge can occur at their tip. This allows charges to slowly leak off from the Earth into the cloud through Corona discharge, thereby reducing the potential difference between the cloud and Earth so that a lightning strike (electrical breakdown) does not occur. When a lightning strike does occur, it will hit the lightning rod, since the electric field at the top of the rod is high and that is the most likely point for the air to break down; but, that is not the goal of the lightning rod!","type":"content","url":"/electricpotential#electric-field-and-potential-at-the-surface-of-a-conductor","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl2":"Capacitors"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/electricpotential#sec-potential-capacitors","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 17 - Electric potential","lvl2":"Capacitors"},"content":"Capacitors are common electronic devices that are used to store electric charge for a variety of applications.

The capacitance of a particular capacitor is a measure of how much charge it can hold at given voltage and depends on the geometry of the capacitor as well as the material between the terminals. If too much charge is placed on a capacitor, the material between the two plates will break down, and a spark will usually damage the capacitor as well as discharge it.\n\nWe can easily calculate the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor.

For example, these might be made of glass (an insulator), with a thin metal coating that one touches to interact with the screen (one of the plates).

The material is chosen to have a higher breakdown voltage than air, so that more charges can be stored before a breakdown occurs. It has also been experimentally observed that the capacitance increases with certain materials, so called “dielectric materials”. A dielectric material has a “dielectric constant”, K, defined to be the amount by which the capacitance increases:C=KC_0\n\nwhere C is the capacitance with the material in place, and C_0 is the capacitance when there is a vacuum between the plates (the dielectric constant of air is very close to 1). Often, rather than the dielectric constant, one uses the “permittivity”, ε, of a material:\\epsilon=K\\epsilon_0\n\nbased on the permittivity of free space, \\epsilon_0.

When the dielectric material is placed between the plates, the dipoles inside the material align themselves with the electric field from the plates. This leads to a second electric field, from the dipoles, in the opposite direction of the field from the plates, thus reducing the total electric field between the plates. This, in turn, allows more charges to be held on the plate for a given voltage.

We can model the amount of energy stored on the capacitor by considering how much work it takes to place the charges on the capacitor.\n\nImagine that both plates on the capacitor start with a charge of magnitude q. We then remove an infinitesimal negative charge, with magnitude dq, from the positive plate and place it on the negative plate. This required work, since we had to pull this negative charge away from the positive plate. If the potential difference across the plates is \\Delta V, then we had to do an amount of work given by:dW = \\Delta Vdq\n\nsince the charge dq has now gained potential energy, \\Delta Vdq.

The potential energy function for a point charge, q, at position \\vec r, relative to a point charge, Q, is given by:U(\\vec r) = \\frac{kQ}{r}q + C\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant, since only differences in potential energy are physically meaningful (as they correspond to work). Note that the sign of the electrical potential energy will depend on the relative sign of q and Q. If a collection of charges are held together, the total electrical potential energy that is stored is called “electrostatic potential energy”.\n\nSimilarly to how the electric field, \\vec E(\\vec r), corresponds to electric force per unit charge, “electric potential”, V(\\vec r), corresponds to electric potential energy per unit charge. The electric potential at a position, \\vec r, relative to a point charge, Q, is given by:V(\\vec r) =\\frac{U(\\vec r)}{q}= \\frac{kQ}{r} + C'\n\nand also depends on an arbitrary constant, C', since only differences in electric potential will lead to differences in potential energy. The value of the electric potential, V, at some position in space, \\vec r, allows us to determine the electric potential energy, U, at that position for any charge, q:U = qV\n\nThis is analogous to determining the force on a charge, q, when we know the electric field at some point in space:\\vec F = q \\vec E\n\nDifferences in electric potential are called “voltages”, and the S.I. unit of potential is called the “volt” (V). In S.I. units, the electric field is often expressed in units of volts per metre (V/m).\n\nWhen a particle with charge q changes position such that the corresponding change in electric potential is \\Delta V, the particle’s potential energy will change by:\\Delta U = q\\Delta V\n\nIn particular, a negative charge will experience a decrease in potential energy when the electric potential increases, whereas a positive charge will experience an increase in potential energy when the electric potential increases. This reflects the fact that the electric force associated with the electric potential will act in opposite directions on a positive and a negative charge.\n\nIn order to describe the energies of particles interacting with electric forces, it is more convenient to use the “electron volt” instead of the Joule. An electron volt is defined as the energy that is gained by a charge with a magnitude e (the magnitude of the charge of the electron) when accelerated through a potential difference of \\Delta V=1 {\\rm V}:1 {\\rm eV}&=(e)(1 {\\rm V})=1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm J}\n\nThe electric potential function can be determined in two different ways:\n\nBy modelling the charge distribution as the sum of infinitesimal point charges, dq, and adding together the electric potentials, dV, from all charges, dq. This requires that one choose 0 {\\rm V} to be located at infinity, so that the dV are all relative to the same point.\n\nBy calculating the electric field (either as a integral or from Gauss’ Law), and using:\\Delta V &=V(\\vec r_B)-V(\\vec r_A)=-\\int_A^B  \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec r\n\nIt is worth noting that one needs to be very careful with the signs when using the above integral. In particular note that one takes the negative of the integral, from A to B, to determine the potential at B minus the potential at A.\n\nSimilarly, one can determine the value of the electric field, \\vec E(\\vec r)=\\vec E(x,y,z), from the electric potential, V(\\vec r)=V(x,y,z):\\vec E(x,y,z) = -\\nabla V =-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\hat x-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\hat y-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z}\\hat z\n\nwhere, \\nabla V, is the gradient of the electric potential.\n\nThe electric potential can be visualized in a number of ways. The most common is to draw contours of constant electric potential, akin to the contours on geographical maps that are used to show regions of constant altitude (i.e. constant gravitational potential energy).\n\nRegions of constant electric potential are called “equipotentials”, and can be lines, surfaces or volumes. Equipotentials are always perpendicular to the electric field. In electrostatics (when charges are not moving), the electric field in a conductor must be zero, so that a conductor always forms an equipotential, and the electric field at the surface of a conductor is always perpendicular to the surface.\n\nWhen charges are placed on a conductor, they will spread out along the outer surface of the conductor. The surface density of charges will be the highest where the conductor has the smallest radius of curvature (e.g. at a sharp point). Consequently, the electric field at the surface of a charged conductor is highest near sharp points.\n\nCapacitors are devices that are used to store charge. They are usually made using two conducting plates (“terminals” or “electrodes”) that hold equal and opposite charge, Q, at a fixed potential difference, \\Delta V , between the electrodes. The amount of charge that is stored on the capacitor is observed to be proportional to the potential difference between the electrodes:Q=C\\Delta V\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality, C, is called the “capacitance” of the capacitor. The S.I. unit of capacitance is the “Farad” (F). The capacitance of a capacitor depends on its geometry (e.g. its size) and the materials that it is placed between the electrodes.\n\nUsually, one places a dielectric material between the two electrodes in order to increase the capacitance, and to reduce the risk of breakdown. If that material has a “dielectric constant”, K, then the capacitance is given by:C=KC_0\n\nwhere, C_0, corresponds to the capacitance if there were vacuum between the electrodes. The dielectric constant of air is very close to 1, so that a capacitor in air is very similar to a capacitor in vacuum. A dielectric material is one that is made of molecules that can be polarized under the presence of an electric field; that is, the molecules have an electric dipole moment. When the molecules in a material are polarized, this reduces the total electric field in the material, which increases the capacitance of the capacitor. Inside a dielectric material, we can define the “permittivity”, ε, as:\\epsilon=K\\epsilon_0\n\nwhere \\epsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space. Within a dielectric material, Gauss’ Law is modified to:\\oint \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec A=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon}\n\nSince charges are held at a fixed potential difference on a capacitor, capacitors are a way of storing electric potential energy. The amount of electric potential energy stored in a capacitor with capacitance, C, when the capacitor has a potential difference, \\Delta V, across its electrodes, is given by:U = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{Q^2}{C} = \\frac{1}{2}C(\\Delta V)^2=\\frac{1}{2}Q\\Delta V\n\nImportant Equations\n\nElectric potential energy from a point chargeU(r)=\\frac{kQq}{r}+C\n\nElectric potentialV=\\frac{U}{q}\n\nElectric potential:\\Delta V = V(\\vec r_B)-V(\\vec r_A)\\\\\n\\Delta V = -\\int_{A}^{B}\\vec E \\cdot d\\vec r\n\nElectric field:\\vec E=-\\nabla V =-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\hat x-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\hat y-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z}\\hat z\n\nElectric potential from a point chargeV(r)=\\frac{kQ}{r}+C\n\nElectric potential between two parallel plates\\Delta V = EL\n\nCharge stored in a capacitor:Q = C\\Delta V\n\nEnergy stored in a capacitorU = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{Q^2}{C} = \\frac{1}{2}C(\\Delta V)^2=\\frac{1}{2}Q\\Delta V\n\nImportant Definitions\n\nCapacitance: How much charge a capacitor can hold given the potential difference between the terminals of the capacitor.

We will do this using Gauss’ Law. We will use a Gaussian surface that is a cylinder of radius, r, and length, L. In both regions, the flux of the electric field will be given by:\\int E\\cdot dA  = E 2\\pi rL\n\nsince the electric field points in the radial direction, away from the centre of the cylinder. Outside of the cylinder (r>R), the total charge enclosed is the total charge on a length, L, of the cylinder, which has a volume, \\pi R^2 L:Q^{enc}=\\rho \\pi R^2 L\n\nThus, applying Gauss’ Law outside the cylinder, gives the electric field for r>R:\\int E\\cdot dA &= \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\nE 2\\pi rL &= \\frac{\\rho \\pi R^2 L}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore E(r) &= \\frac{\\rho R^2}{2\\epsilon_0r}\\quad(r\\geq R)\n\nInside the cylinder, the enclosed charge is that enclosed by a cylinder of radius, r, and length, L:Q^{enc}=\\rho \\pi r^2 L\n\nApplying Gauss’ Law, the electric field inside the cylinder is given by:\\int E\\cdot dA &= \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\nE 2\\pi rL &= \\frac{\\rho \\pi r^2 L}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore E(r) &= \\frac{\\rho r}{2\\epsilon_0}\\quad(r<R)\n\nNow that we have found the electric field, we can determine the electric potential. What we really want to find is the change in potential when moving a positive point charge from infinity (our 0 {\\rm V} point) to the point of interest. We know that the potential at the surface (meaning the potential difference between infinity and the surface) is V_S=100 {\\rm V}. To find the potential at any point, all we have to do is calculate the potential difference between the surface and the point of interest, and add that to V_S.\n\nWe will start with the potential inside the cylinder, r<R:\\Delta V_{r<R} &= V(r)-V_S = -\\int_{R}^{r} \\vec E\\cdot d \\vec r\\\\\n&= -\\int_{R}^{r} \\frac{\\rho r}{2\\epsilon_0} \\hat r \\cdot d \\vec r\\\\\n&= -\\int_{R}^{r} \\frac{\\rho r}{2\\epsilon_0} dr\\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\rho (r^2-R^2)}{4\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\rho (R^2-r^2)}{4\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore V(r) &= V_S + \\frac{\\rho (R^2-r^2)}{4\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n&=100 {\\rm V}+\\frac{\\rho (R^2-r^2)}{4\\epsilon_0}\n\nThus, everywhere inside the cylinder, the electric potential is larger than 100 {\\rm V}, since R^2-r^2>0.\n\nWe proceed in the same way to determine the potential at position r outside the cylinder, r>R:\\Delta V_{r>R} &=  V(r) - V_S = -\\int_{R}^{r} \\vec E\\cdot d \\vec r\\\\\n&= -\\int_{R}^{r} \\frac{\\rho R^2}{2\\epsilon_0r} \\hat r \\cdot d \\vec r\\\\\n&= - \\frac{\\rho R^2}{2\\epsilon_0} \\int_{R}^{r} \\frac{1}{r}dr\\\\\n&=- \\frac{\\rho R^2}{2\\epsilon_0}(\\ln r-\\ln R)\\\\\n&=- \\frac{\\rho R^2}{2\\epsilon_0}\\ln\\left( \\frac{r}{R} \\right)\\\\\n\\therefore V(r) &= V_S - \\frac{\\rho R^2}{2\\epsilon_0} \\ln \\left( \\frac{r}{R} \\right)\\\\\n&= 100 {\\rm V} - \\frac{\\rho R^2}{2\\epsilon_0} \\ln \\left( \\frac{r}{R} \\right)\n\nSince r>R, \\ln (r/R) is positive, so the electric potential decreases from as you move away from the cylinder, as expected.\n\nSolution 17.2\n\nWe will determine the capacitance by relating the potential difference between the electrodes to the charge stored on the electrodes. Using Gauss’s Law, we can determine the electric field between the electrodes based on the charge on those electrodes, and from there, we can determine the potential difference. We will ignore the fact that the cylinder has a finite length and that Gauss’s Law will not hold near the edges of the cylinder, where the electric field is no longer exactly in the radial direction.\n\nWe assume that each electrode carries an equal and opposite charge per unit length, λ. In order to determine the electric field in the region R_A<r<R_B, we consider a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r and length L, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 16. The surface encloses a charge Q^{enc}=\\lambda L from the inner cylinder.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Solving for E between two cylinders using Gauss’ law.\n\nApplying Gauss’ Law:\\int E\\cdot dA &= \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\nE 2\\pi rL &= \\frac{\\lambda L}{\\epsilon_0}\\\\\n\\therefore E(r) &= \\frac{\\lambda }{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 r}\n\nand the electric field points in the radial direction (outwards if the inner electrode is positive). We can find the potential difference between the two electrodes using the electric field:\\Delta V &= V(R_B)-V(R_A)= -\\int_{R_A}^{R_B} \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec r\\\\\n&=-\\int_{R_A}^{R_B} \\frac{\\lambda }{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 r} dr\\\\\n&= -\\frac{\\lambda }{2\\pi \\epsilon_0}\\ln\\left( \\frac{R_B}{R_A} \\right)\n\nwhere we should note that the minus sign is ambiguous, as the actual sign of the potential difference will depend on the sign of λ, the charge on the inner cylinder. If the charge on the inner cylinder is positive, the potential difference is negative, indicating that the outer cylinder is at a lower potential than the inner one (which makes sense, as the electric field would point outwards between the two cylinders).\n\nWe can determine the capacitance between the electrodes, by taking the absolute value of the potential difference above, and using the fact that the charge, Q, on a length, L, of one electrode is given by Q=\\lambda L:Q &= C\\Delta V\\\\\n\\lambda L &= C\\frac{\\lambda }{2\\pi \\epsilon_0}\\ln\\left( \\frac{R_B}{R_A} \\right)\\\\\n\\therefore C&=\\frac{2\\pi \\epsilon_0}{L\\ln\\left( \\frac{R_B}{R_A} \\right)}\n\nWe note that the capacitance does not depend on the (arbitrary) charge per unit length, λ that we placed on the inner cylinder in order to model the capacitor. The capacitance only depends on the geometry of the capacitor, and the material that is used between the plates.\n\nThis is the amount of charge on one of the plates. As a whole, the capacitor is neutral.","type":"content","url":"/electricpotential#solutions","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/current","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/current","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/current#chapter-current","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"In this chapter, we introduce tools to model electric current, namely, the motion of charges inside a conductor.

In electrostatic systems, the electric field inside of a conductor is zero (by definition, or charges would be moving, since they are free to move in a conductor). We argued that if charges are deposited onto a conductor, they would quickly arrange themselves into a static configuration (on the surface of the conductor).\n\nTo build a system that is not electrostatic, we could apply a fixed potential difference across the conductor. This would create an  electric field inside the conductor, causing the electrons to move. In general, this requires the formation of a circuit, whereby charges enter one end of the conductor and exit the other. The most simple circuit is constructed by connecting the two terminals of a battery to the ends of a conductor, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:A simple circuit is created by connecting the terminals of a battery to a conducting material such as a copper wire. Note that while electrons flow from the negative to the positive terminal of the battery, conventional current is defined as if it were positive charges moving in the opposite direction.\n\nA battery (as we will see in more detail in \n\nSection 19.1 is a device that provides a source of charges and a fixed potential difference. For example, a 9 {\\rm V} battery has two terminals with a constant voltage of 9 {\\rm V} between them.\n\n“Electric current” is defined to be the rate at which charges cross a given plane (usually a plane perpendicular to some conductor through which we want to define the current). We define current, I, as the total amount of charge, \\Delta Q, that flows through any cross-section of the conductor during an amount of time, \\Delta t:\\boxed{I=\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dQ}{dt}}\n\nwhere we must take a derivative if the rate of flow is not constant in time. The S.I. unit of current is the Amp`ere (\\si{A}). In almost all cases, it is negative electrons that flow through a material. However, the current is defined to be in the direction of the flow of positive charges, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 1. To distinguish that the current is in the direction opposite to that of the flowing electrons, one sometimes uses the term “conventional current” to indicate that the current is referring to a flow of positive charges.\n\nNote that the definition of electric current is very similar to the “flow rate”, Q, that we defined as the volume flow of a liquid across a given cross-section (\n\nSection 14.4.1). As we continue to develop our description of current, you will notice that there are many similarities between describing the flow of an incompressible fluid and describing the flow of charges in a conductor.\n\nWe think of current as a macroscopic quantity, something that we can easily measure in the lab. Current is a measure of the average rate at which charges are moving through the conductor, and not a measure of what is going on at a microscopic level. In order to model the motion of charges at the microscopic level, we introduce the “current density”, \\vec j:\\boxed{\\vec j = \\frac{I}{A}\\hat E}\n\nwhere I is the current that flows through a surface with cross-sectional area A and \\hat E is a unit vector in the direction of the electric field at our point of interest. As its name would suggest, the current density is the electric current per unit area. It follows that, given the current density, \\vec j, one can always determine the current through a surface with area A and normal vector \\hat n:I = A(\\vec j\\cdot \\hat n)\n\nIf the current density changes over the surface, one must take an integral instead:I=\\int \\vec j \\cdot d\\vec A\n\nwhere d\\vec A is a surface element with area A and direction given by the normal to the surface at that point. The overall sign of the current will be determined by the direction of the flow of positive charges.\n\nExample 18.1\n\nElectric current flows through a conductor with a narrowing cross section, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 2. If the cross-sectional area the conductor is A_1 at one end, and A_2, at the other end, what is the ratio of the current densities, j_1/j_2, at the two ends of the conductor?\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Current flows through a conductor with a cross-section that decreases from A_1 to A_2.\n\nThis situation is very similar to the flow of an incompressible fluid. In this case, the number of charges entering the conductor must be equal to the number of charges exiting the conductor during a given amount of time. That is, the total current, I, must be the same at both ends, since there is no place in the conductor for charges to accumulate. Since the current must be the same on both ends, we can relate the current densities at each end:j&=\\frac{I}{A}\\\\\n\\therefore I&=j_1A_1=j_2A_2\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{j_2}{j_1}&=\\frac{A_1}{A_2}\n\nand we find that the current density at the exit of the conductor must be higher than at the entrance. This is similar to the continuity equation in the Fluid Mechanics chapter (\n\nSection 14.4.1), where the current density plays a role analogous to the velocity in the fluids case.","type":"content","url":"/current#current","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl2":"Microscopic model of current"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/current#sec-current-micromodel","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl2":"Microscopic model of current"},"content":"Consider a cylindrical conductor of cross-sectional area A and length L, as shown in \n\nFigure 3. A potential difference, \\Delta V, is applied across the length of the conductor, so that there is an electric field, \\vec E, everywhere within the conductor. If the conductor were made of empty space, electrons would enter one end of the conductor, accelerate through the potential difference, and arrive at the other end with a high speed, having gained e\\Delta V of kinetic energy. In reality, the conductor is made of matter, and electrons do not accelerate continuously through the whole length of the conductor. Instead, they can only accelerate over a short distance before colliding with an atom in the material (rather, a tightly bound electron in the material), and losing their kinetic energy to the material, before accelerating again. The motion of electrons flowing in a conductor is illustrated in \n\nFigure 3 and shows electrons moving with a wide range of velocities following the collisions, and only an average motion in the direction anti-parallel to the electric field.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Electrons moving inside a conductor only “drift” on average in the direction anti-parallel to the electric field. In reality, they constantly collide with atoms in the material, transferring their kinetic energy into thermal energy of the conductor.\n\nThus, when the electrons arrive at the positive side of the conductor, they have not gained any kinetic energy. Instead, they have lost that kinetic energy to atoms of the conducting material through collisions; those atoms then vibrate which we can measure as an increase in temperature of the material. When current flows through a conductor, that conductor will heat up; this is how the heating elements in your toaster work!\n\nWe model the motion of electrons as charges “drifting” through the conductor with a velocity \\vec v_d, the “drift velocity”, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4. In reality, of course, the electrons are only moving on average with the drift velocity, and their instantaneous speed is generally much larger than the drift velocity and can be in any direction, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A section of electrons of length l drifting through a conductor of cross-sectional area, A.\n\nIn a conducting material, each atom will generally have one “free” electron that is loosely bound and able to easily move through the material. The number of free electrons available for conduction per unit volume, n, will depend on properties of the material (its density, how many electrons per atom are available, etc). Consider the motion of the conduction electrons present in a section of length l of a conductor, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4. The amount of charge, \\Delta Q, contained in a section of the conductor with length l is given by:\\Delta Q= -e n Al\n\nwhere Al is the volume of that section of the conductor, and e is the magnitude of the charge of the electron. The negative sign is to indicate that the charges are negative (they are electrons). That charge will take an amount of time, \\Delta t, to flow through a given plane of the conductor, so that we can relate the length of the section, l, to the drift speed and \\Delta t:l&=v_d\\Delta t\n\nThus, the current that flows through a cross-section of the conductor is given by:I=\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{-e n Al}{\\Delta t}=-enAv_d\\therefore\\;\\boxed{I=-enAv_d},\n\nwhich allows us to connect a macroscopic quantity, current, to the microscopic description of moving charges. Note that the negative sign reflects the fact that the current (of positive charges) is in the opposite direction from the drift velocity of the (negative) electrons. The current density is directly related to the microscopic quantities, since it does not depend on the (macroscopic) cross-sectional area, A, of the conductor:\\vec j&=\\frac{I}{A}\\hat E = -en\\vec v_d\\therefore\\; \\boxed{\\vec j = -en\\vec v_d}\n\nwhere, again, the negative sign indicates that the current density is in the opposite direction from the actual drift velocity of the electrons, which itself is anti-parallel to the electric field.\n\nExample 18.2\n\nA current of 1 {\\rm A} is measured in a copper wire with a diameter of 1 {\\rm mm}. What is the drift velocity of the electrons? Assume that each atom of copper provides one “free electron” for conduction.\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to determine the drift velocity of electrons, we need to know the density of free electrons in copper. To do this, we need to determine how many copper atoms there are per unit volume. The density of copper is \\rho=8.92e3 {\\rm kg/m^3} and the atomic mass unit of copper is 63.5 {\\rm amu} (1 {\\rm mole} of copper weighs 63.5 {\\rm g}). The number of copper atoms per unit volume is thus:n=\\frac{(6.022e23 {\\rm mole^{-1}})(8.92e3 {\\rm kg/m^3})}{(63.5e-3 {\\rm kg/mole})}=8.46e28 {\\rm m^{-3}}\n\nSince each copper atom contributes one free electron, this is the same as the density of free electrons. From this, we easily obtain the drift velocity from the current:v_d&=\\frac{j}{en}=\\frac{I}{Aen}=\\frac{(1 {\\rm A})}{\\pi(0.0005 {\\rm m})^2(1.6e-19 {\\rm C})(8.46e28 {\\rm m^{-3}})}\\\\\n&=9.4e-5 {\\rm m/s}\\sim0.1 {\\rm mm/s}\n\nThe drift velocity is thus very slow, less than one millimetre per second. Note that a 1 {\\rm mm} diameter copper wire would not actually be able to sustain such a high current density without damage.\n\nJosh’s Thoughts\n\nThere are a few types of velocities which can be easily confused when discussing current: Fermi velocity, drift velocity, and the velocity at which a circuit is “completed”.\n\nUnderstanding the Fermi velocity requires quantum mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. However, the Fermi velocity is representative of the actual velocity of electrons in a conducting material, mostly due to their thermal energy. In a good conductor, these speed are roughly 1/200 the speed of light.\n\nWhile electrons do move at their Fermi velocity in a conductor, they do not move in a uniform path through the conductor towards the end of the circuit. Most of an electron’s movement in a wire is chaotic, but in a DC circuit, the electrons have a drift velocity through the conductor. This drift velocity is defined as the net velocity of electrons in a conductor, and is caused by the applied electric field which has a small amount of influence on the direction of the quickly moving electron’s motion. The drift velocity of electrons is very slow, often having a magnitude as small as tens of microns per second.\n\nWhen comparing drift velocity to Fermi speed, imagine yourself standing inside of a large horizontal cylinder, which will represent the conductor in this analogy. The interior of this cylinder is lined with cannons that shoot rubber balls in all directions, which will be the electrons moving at their Fermi velocity. Now, imagine that you are attempting to move these high-speed rubber balls from one end of the cylinder to the other by blowing a hair dryer in that direction, which is the electric field inducing a drift velocity.\n\nNow that we understand the quantum chaos that occurs in a conductor, you may be thinking to yourself, “why does the light bulb turn on so quickly after I flick the light switch?”. This is a reasonable thought, because we have only covered the motion of single particles in a conductor. When an electron moves very slightly (at its drift velocity), it will push other electrons in the conductor forward, causing a chain reaction of electrons pushing one another forward. This movement causes electrons to flow through the circuit, much like how water flows through a pipe. The velocity at which a light bulb turns on after the flicking of a switch is theoretically the speed of light, but short delays caused by irregularities in the way electrons bump into one another causes the velocity to be roughly 50 to 99 percent of the speed of light.","type":"content","url":"/current#sec-current-micromodel","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl2":"Ohm’s Law"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/current#ohms-law","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl2":"Ohm’s Law"},"content":"In the previous section, we developed a microscopic model of charges moving in a conductor, but did not describe how this motion is affected by the electric field in the conductor (or equivalently, the potential difference across the conductor). “Ohm’s Law” states that the current density, \\vec j, at some position in the conductor is proportional to the electric field, \\vec E, at that same position in the conductor:\\vec j \\propto \\vec E\\boxed{\\vec j = \\sigma \\vec E}\n\nwhere we have introduced the “conductivity”, σ, as the constant of proportionality.

The difference is that the resistivity is a fundamental property of a material (and is microscopic), whereas resistance depends on the size and shape of the conductor, as well as the resistivity (and is macroscopic). It is tempting to think about resistivity as the “resistance density”, because it is similar to the concepts of mass density and charge density. However, we have to be careful because resistivity is not resistance per unit volume (\\rho \\neq R/(A\\cdot L)), and is instead related to resistance by \\rho=R\\cdot (A/L).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat are the SI units of conductivity?\n\n{\\rm \\frac{\\Omega}{C}}.\n\n{\\rm \\frac{1}{\\Omega m}}.\n\n{\\rm \\frac{N^2 \\Omega}{C}}.\n\n{\\rm \\frac{C}{s}}.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe model to describe the resistance of a conductor to the flow of electric current under a fixed potential difference, \\Delta V, is identical to the model that we derived in \n\nSection 14.4.4 to describe the Poiseuille flow, Q, of an viscous incompressible fluid in a pipe with resistance, R, under a pressure difference, \\Delta P:\\Delta P = RQ\n\nThus, one can think of electric current by analogy to the incompressible flow of a viscous fluid through a pipe. If the pipe is longer, it opposes more resistance to the flow of liquid, just as a longer resistor has a larger resistance to current. A pipe with a larger cross-sectional area has less resistance to the flow of liquid, just as a resistor with a larger cross sectional area, A, has a lower resistance.","type":"content","url":"/current#resistance","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl3":"Combining resistors","lvl2":"Resistors"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/current#combining-resistors","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl3":"Combining resistors","lvl2":"Resistors"},"content":"Resistors are the most common component in circuits, and we show below how to model the equivalent resistance of two resistors that are combined in “parallel” or in “series”.\n\nFigure 7 shows two resistors, R_1 and R_2, connected in “series”, to form an an effective resistor with resistance R_{eff}.

This rating assumes that the appliance will be connected to a fixed potential difference (120 {\\rm V} in North America), so it is  straightforward to determine the current that they will draw. This is important because the current that is drawn by the appliance has to go through the wiring in the house, and if the current is too large, the wiring (which has resistance) will heat up (P=I^2R) which could result in an electrical fire. Circuits in a house have safety devices (fuses or breakers) that are designed to interrupt the circuit if the current is too large.\n\nOne can rate a power supply, such as a battery, by the amount of power that it can deliver. Power supplies are usually designed to supply a fixed potential difference; for example, a 9 {\\rm V} battery supplies a constant voltage of 9 {\\rm V}. If a small resistor is connected across the terminals of the battery, a large current, I, will flow through the resistor. In principle, the current through the resistor will be given by Ohm’s Law, I=\\Delta V/R. However, by reducing the resistance, the current will increase, and the power dissipated by the resistor, P=I\\Delta V , would increase indefinitely. Obviously, this is not possible, as it requires the battery to supply energy at the same, ever increasing rate. In practice, as the resistance is decreased, the current through the resistor will only increase until I \\Delta V is equal to the maximal power that can be dissipated by the battery. As the resistance across the battery is further decreased, the voltage across the battery will start to decrease as well, so that the power dissipated in the resistor, I \\Delta V, does not exceed the power that the battery could possibly supply.","type":"content","url":"/current#electrical-power-dissipated-in-resistors","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl3":"Superconductors","lvl2":"Resistors"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/current#superconductors","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 18 - Electric current","lvl3":"Superconductors","lvl2":"Resistors"},"content":"Superconductors are materials that, under certain conditions, have zero resistivity.

This is called “direct current” (DC) as the charges move in a constant direction through the resistor. Batteries supply fixed voltages, and circuits with batteries will almost always have DC current. The voltage that is supplied between two of the sockets in a household electrical outlet is “alternating”, and leads to “alternating current” (AC), where charges move back and forth, with no net displacement.\n\nThe potential difference across a household outlet varies sinusoidally:\\Delta V (t) = \\Delta V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\n\nwhere \\Delta V_0 is the maximal amplitude of the voltage (120 {\\rm V} in North America, 220 {\\rm V} in Europe), and \\omega = 2\\pi f is the angular frequency of the voltage (f=60 {\\rm Hz} in North America, f=50 {\\rm Hz} in Europe).

However, this does not mean that zero  energy is dissipated, since the electrons in the resistor will still collide with atoms as they oscillate back and forth. We can define the average power, \\bar P, that is dissipated in the resistor as the  power that is dissipated over one oscillation cycle (with period, T). To obtain the latter, we calculate the total energy, E, dissipated in the resistor over one cycle so that the power is simply given by E/T. We divide the interval of time, T, into infinitesimally small intervals, dt, so that the infinitesimal energy, dE, dissipated in an infinitesimal time, dt, is given by:dE=P(t) dt\n\nThe total energy dissipated in one period is then given by:E=\\int dE = \\int_0^T P(t)dt\n\nso that the power dissipated in one cycle is given by:\\bar P=\\frac{E}{T}=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T P(t)dt\n\nThe instantaneous power, P(t), can be described in terms of the instantaneous current, P(t)=I^2(t)R, so that the average power can be written as:\\bar P = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^TP(t)dt=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^TI(t)^2Rdt=RI_0^2\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T\\sin^2(\\omega t)dt=\\frac{1}{2}RI_0^2\n\nwhere we used the fact that T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} to evaluate the integral.

The two main hazards associated with electricity are fire and electrocution. Typically, an electrical fire is the result of a large current going through a resistor, as the power dissipated in a resistor is proportional the square of the current through that resistor. If you connect an appliance that draws a large current to your outlets, the wires in your house (i.e. resistors) could heat up enough to cause a fire (e.g. by heating up insulation that is close by). This danger is primarily mitigated by using “fuses” or “circuit breakers” that will interrupt the circuit if the current is too large. A fuse is a simple device with a thin wire (high resistance) that will melt and break if too much current goes through it (which is designed to happen long before the wires in your house start to overheat). A circuit breaker is a resettable switch that opens under a large current. Modern houses do not use fuses any more, since they have to be replaced every time they are “blown”.\n\nElectrocution is a form of injury that is the result of a current crossing the body; we can think of the body as a resistor connected between the terminals of a battery. Injuries can be caused simply by burns (tissue destroyed), or by muscles contracting involuntarily due to the current. For example, one’s muscles may contract in such a way that the person cannot let go of the source of current. If a current of more than about 80 {\\rm mA} passes through the mid section of a person, enough current could go through the heart so that it starts to beat very irregularly (“ventricular fibrillation”) which can lead to death since blood stops flowing normally. A very large current can cause the heart to simply stop beating, which could sometimes be less dangerous than ventricular fibrillation (if for a short period of time, and of course, the burns will be more severe from a larger current). A “defibrillator” is designed to provide such a high current that the heart stops briefly, with the hope that when it starts back, the beats will be regular. This can be used in cases of ventricular fibrillation (caused by electrocution or other). One often hears that “it’s current that kills”, which is a statement that being electrocuted by a certain voltage is not a good measure of the resulting injury, since the current will depend on the resistance of the person’s body.\n\nThe amount of current that will go through a person will depend on the resistance of the person’s body. Internal tissues and organs are typically quite conductive and have low resistance. The outer layer of the skin, on the other hand, has a high resistance when dry and helps to limit the current that can go through the body. The resistance of dry skin is usually considerably above 1e4 {\\rm \\Omega}, while it can be much less than 1e3 {\\rm \\Omega} when wet. With wet skin, a potential difference of 120 {\\rm V} (as in a North American outlet) can easily lead to a current above 100 {\\rm mA}, which could easily be fatal. Note that being barefoot and in contact with the ground is usually a low resistance connection, since there is often a thin layer of sweat on your feet.\n\nIn North America, electrical outlets have a minimum of two sockets: a “live” socket (with an oscillating voltage, usually a black wire), and a “neutral” socket which is connected to the ground and relative to which the oscillating voltage has an amplitude of 120 {\\rm V} (usually a white wire). One can obviously be electrocuted by simultaneously touching the wires in both sockets, and usually simply by touching the wire in the live socket, since one’s feet are usually connected to ground. Electrocution by directly touching the socket is fairly uncommon, since most people know not to do that (right?!). Usually, one is electrocuted by an appliance with faulty wiring; perhaps the insulation on the live wire is worn out and you touch the wire by mistake, or the wiring in the appliance is faulty, causing the casing of the appliance to be live. In order to mitigate the risk of electrocution from an appliance with faulty wiring, most outlets will have a third socket, the “dedicated ground”. The dedicated ground wire is connected to the ground inside the socket, and to the casing of the appliance, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 12. Thus, if the live wire were to be in contact with the casing of the appliance, the dedicated ground provides a low resistance path for current to take that is in parallel with your body (so that most current will go through the low resistance path).\n\n\n\nFigure 12:When an appliance has three prongs on its electrical cable, the middle prong grounds the case to the dedicated ground as a safety measure.

Conventional current is defined to be positive in the direction in which positive charges flow. In most situations, it is electrons that move inside a conductor, so the current is defined to be positive in the opposite direction of the actual motion of the (negative) electrons.\n\nThe current density, \\vec j, is defined to be the current per unit area at some point in a conductor, and is a vector in the direction of the electric field, \\hat E, at that point:\\vec j = \\frac{I}{A}\\hat E\n\nThe current density can be related to the microscopic motion of charges within the conductor.

When a potential difference is applied across a resistor, the resulting electric field will drive the flow of electrons through the resistor. The electrons will flow with an average “drift velocity”, \\vec v_d, which is much lower than the actual (Fermi) speed of the electrons in the material. Inside the resistor, electrons are constantly accelerated before they collide with atoms in the material losing their kinetic energy, and then accelerating again. Thus, the potential energy that is available to the electrons is “used” to heat the resistor, and the electrons, on average, drift quite slowly through the resistor.\n\nThe current density in a resistor can be related to the drift velocity of the electrons and the “density of free electrons” in the material, n:\\vec j = -en\\vec v_d\n\nwhere, e,  is the magnitude of the charge of the electrons and the minus sign indicates that the current density is in the opposite direction of the velocity of the (negative) electrons.\n\nOhm’s Law states that the current density, \\vec j, at some point in the conductor is proportional to the electric field, \\vec E, at that point:\\vec j=\\sigma \\vec E=\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\vec E\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality, σ, is called the “conductivity” of the material (and is a property of the material through which current is flowing). The resistivity, ρ, is a material property that is simply the inverse of the conductivity. Both of these properties are a measure of how large a current (or current density) will exist in a material given a certain electric field. For example, the conductivity of an insulating material is close to zero (and its resistivity close to infinity).\n\nFor most materials, resistivity usually increases linearly with temperature:\\rho(T)=\\rho_0[1+\\alpha(T-T_0)]\n\nwhere \\rho_0 is the resistivity as measured at some reference temperature, T_0 (usually 20 {\\rm \\degree C}), and α, is the “temperature coefficient” for that material. Note that this model of resistivity does not hold for extreme temperatures (very cold or very hot), and for some materials, resistivity decreases with temperature (α is negative).\n\nIf we apply Ohm’s Law to a resistor of length, L, cross-sectional area, A, made of a material with resistivity, ρ, we find that the potential difference applied across the resistor, \\Delta V, is proportional to the current flowing through the resistor:\\Delta V =\\rho \\frac{L}{A} I\n\nThe constant of proportionality depends on the material with which the resistor is made (through the resistivity) and on the dimensions of the resistor (through the length and cross-sectional area).

Electrical fires can arise when a large current goes through a wire, since this will dissipate a large amount of heat into the wire (which could set fire to its insulation or other nearby flammable items). Electrocution occurs when a current traverses the human body. If a current above \\sim80 {\\rm mA} crosses the upper body, this can result in ventricular fibrillation, whereby the heart beats very irregularly. Of course, one can also be burned by a large current. The amount of current through the body is what will ultimately determine the severity of injuries, and is why one often hears that “it’s current that kills”.

Luigi Galvani was the first to realize that certain combinations of metals placed into contact with each other can lead to an electric potential difference (or rather, he realized that they can make the legs of a dead frog twitch, which we now understand to be from the potential difference due to the metals). Effectively, Galvani created the first “electrochemical cell”.

A simple cell, similar to that originally made by Volta, is comprised of two metal electrodes placed in a liquid called electrolyte, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 1. Common materials used are carbon (Volta used silver) and zinc for the electrodes, and sulfuric acid for the electrolyte. Before the cell is constructed, the electrodes and the electrolyte are all electrically neutral.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:A simple electric cell, where zinc ions dissolve in sulfuric acid leaving electrons on the metal.TODO Is it incorrect to show the electrons entering the solution?\n\nOnce the zinc is immersed in the electrolyte, the zinc atoms tend to dissolve into the electrolyte in the form of zinc ions (doubly charged, Zn2+). This leaves an excess of electrons on the zinc electrode, resulting in a net negative electric charge. Similarly, the positively charged zinc ions attract electrons from the carbon electrode into the solution, leaving the carbon electrode positively charged. Very quickly, an equilibrium is reached, since at some point, the negative charge of the zinc electrode will electrically attract positive zinc ions, preventing any more zinc ions from dissolving into the solution. Similarly, as the carbon electrode builds a positive charge, that charge will eventually prevent electrons from “jumping” into the solution. At this point, there will be a fixed electric potential difference between the two electrodes (terminals) of the battery.\n\nIf the two electrodes are connected together through a resistor, the electrons will leave the zinc electrode, cross the resistor, and end up on the positive carbon electrode. This will leave space for more electrons on the zinc electrode, so more zinc ions will dissolve into the solution. Thus, a circuit is formed, where electron travel up the zinc electrode, through the resistor and back down the carbon electrode. At the same time, more and more zinc ions dissolve into the electrolyte, until the zinc electrode is completely dissolved. In practice, the zinc ions travel through the solution and plate onto the carbon electrode (the electrons do not quite “jump” into the electrolyte, rather, it is the zinc ions that move in the electrolyte). Since the charge on the electrodes is continuously replenished, the potential difference between the electrodes remains constant even as current is flowing.\n\nThe electric cell will stop working once the zinc electrode has completely dissolved (this is what happens when your battery is dead). Note that there is also a maximum current that the cell can supply, which depends on the rate at which the zinc can dissolve into the electrolyte and plate onto the carbon electrode. If the electrodes of the cell are connected with a very low resistance resistor, the resulting current will be too large for the potential difference to be maintained. Most electric cells work in similar ways, although the chemical reactions can be much more complex. Sometimes, the chemical reaction is reversible; one could use a different battery to apply a negative voltage to the carbon electrode to reverse the reaction and plate the zinc back onto the zinc electrode, thus “recharging the battery” (and converting electric energy back into stored chemical potential energy).","type":"content","url":"/circuits#the-electrochemical-cell","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl3":"The ideal battery in a circuit","lvl2":"Batteries and simple circuits"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/circuits#the-ideal-battery-in-a-circuit","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl3":"The ideal battery in a circuit","lvl2":"Batteries and simple circuits"},"content":"As we proceed, we will use the term “battery” loosely to refer to a device (such as an electric cell or collection of cells) that can provide a fixed potential difference between two terminals (or electrodes). \n\nFigure 2 shows the circuit diagram for a battery, consisting of two (or four) vertical bars, with the larger bar indicating the positive terminal of the battery.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Circuit diagram symbols that can be used for a battery.\n\nFigure 3 shows the circuit diagram symbols that are used for a resistor (different symbols are used in North American and in Europe).\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Circuit diagram symbols for a resistor, using the North American convention (left), and the European convention (right).\n\nFigure 4 shows a circuit diagram for a very simple circuit consisting of a single 9 {\\rm V} battery connected to a 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor. When drawing a circuit diagram (or making a real circuit), one connects the various components together (e.g. batteries and resistors) with segments of wire that have zero resistance, even if, in practice, wires always have some resistance. However, since the wires are connected in series with resistors (or other components that have a resistance), one can always include the resistance of the wires by adding it to the resistance of the other components. For example, in \n\nFigure 4, if the wires have a total resistance of 1 {\\rm \\Omega}, we could simply model the circuit as if the resistor had a resistance of 3 {\\rm \\Omega} instead of 2 {\\rm \\Omega}. In practice, this is usually accounted for when a circuit diagram is made (i.e. any resistors include the resistance of the wires connected to it).\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A simple circuit, showing a 9 {\\rm V} battery and a 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor. For ease in analyzing circuits, we suggest drawing a ``battery arrow\" above batteries that goes from the negative to the positive terminal.\n\nThe circuit in \n\nFigure 4 is simple to analyze. In this case, whichever charges exit one terminal of the battery must pass through the resistor and then enter the other terminal of the battery. We always use conventional current to analyze a circuit. Thus, we model the circuit as if positive charges exit the positive terminal of the battery, go through the resistor, and then enter the negative terminal of the battery.\n\nWe recommend that you always draw a “battery arrow” for each battery in a circuit diagram to indicate the direction in which the electric potential increases and in which direction the conventional current would exit the battery if a simple resistor were connected across the battery. We also indicate the current that is flowing in any wire of the circuit by drawing an arrow in the direction of current on that wire (labelled I in \n\nFigure 4).In complex circuits, the current may not necessarily flow in the same direction as the battery arrow, and the battery arrow makes it easier to analyze those circuits.\n\nIt is helpful to think about the value of the electric potential along different parts of a circuit. Below (\n\nFigure 5), we have taken the circuit from \n\nFigure 4 and highlighted regions where the electric potential is constant.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:The same circuit as in \n\nFigure 4 showing the two regions over which the electric potential is constant.\n\nSince the wires have no resistance, the electric potential is constant along a wire. In other words, because the wire has no resistance, the charges/current cannot dissipate any power in the wire (P=I^2R), and the charges do not “lose” any potential energy (and so the potential cannot change). The only place where the charges can dissipate energy is inside the resistor. Once the charges have crossed the resistor, the electric potential in the wire is again constant until they reach the other terminal of the battery. Thus, in this simple circuit, the electric potential difference across the resistor is the same as the potential difference across the terminals of the battery.  This is shown by the coloured areas in \n\nFigure 5. If we choose 0 {\\rm V} to be defined at the negative terminal of the battery, then the potential is 9 {\\rm V} everywhere in the red area (to the right of the resistor), and 0 {\\rm V} everywhere in the grey area (to the left of the resistor).\n\nWe can apply Ohm’s Law (the macroscopic version) to the resistor and determine the current in the circuit, since we know the potential difference across the resistor:\\Delta V&=RI\\\\\n\\therefore I&=\\frac{\\Delta V}{R}=\\frac{(9 {\\rm V})}{(2 {\\rm \\Omega})}=4.5 {\\rm A}\n\nIt is helpful to think of circuits in terms of energy. Charges move along the circuit and their potential energy changes as they go through components, while it remains constant as they move through a wire. If a positive charge enters the negative terminal of a battery and exits the positive terminal, its potential energy will have increased. If that charge then enters a resistor, its potential energy will decrease as it moves through the resistor, since the charge will “use” its potential energy to heat up the resistor. Batteries provide the energy to “push” the charges through the resistors in the circuit by converting chemical potential energy into the electrical potential energy of the charges.\n\nIt is also useful to make the analogy with fluid dynamics; one can think of the battery as a pump that is continuously pushing a viscous incompressible fluid through a pipe with a narrow section, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 6. The wide section of the pipe is akin to the wires with no resistance, and the narrow section is akin to the resistor. The pressure difference generated by the pump is analogous to the voltage produced by the battery, and the flow rate of the liquid is analogous to the electric current. The pressure in the pipe does not drop in the wide section, if there is no resistance. The entire pressure drop of the fluid is across the narrow section, just as the voltage only drops across the resistor.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A fluid dynamics analogue of the circuit in \n\nFigure 4, where a pump plays the role of the battery, and a narrow pipe that of a resistor.\n\nExample 19.1\n\nTwo resistors, of 2 {\\rm \\Omega} and 4 {\\rm \\Omega}, respectively, are connected in series to a 12 {\\rm V} battery. What is the current through each of the resistors, and what is the voltage across each resistor?\n\nSolution\n\nWe start by making a circuit diagram, as in \n\nFigure 7, showing the resistors, the current, I, the battery and the battery arrow. Note that since this is a closed circuit with only one path, the current through the battery, I, is the same as the current through the two resistors.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:Two resistors connected in series with a battery.\n\nIf we choose the potential on the negative side of the battery to be 0 {\\rm V}, then points {\\rm a} and {\\rm e} on the diagram are at a potential of 0 {\\rm V}, since potential cannot change in a wire with no resistance. Similarly, the points at {\\rm b} and {\\rm c} are at a potential of 12 {\\rm V} (relative to points {\\rm a} and {\\rm e}). At point {\\rm d}, between the two resistors, the potential will be between 0 {\\rm V} and 12 {\\rm V}, since the potential will “drop” as the current goes through the 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor.\n\nThe easiest way to determine the current through this simple circuit is to combine the two resistors into a single effective resistor with resistance:R_{eff}=(2 {\\rm \\Omega})+(4 {\\rm \\Omega})=6 {\\rm \\Omega}\n\nso that the circuit can be simplified to that shown in \n\nFigure 8:\n\n\n\nFigure 8:The resistors from the circuit in \n\nFigure 7 have been combined in series to simplify the circuit.\n\nThe potential difference across the effective resistor is the same as that across the battery (between points {\\rm e} and {\\rm c}), so that Ohm’s Law can be applied to the effective resistor to determine the current that traverses it:\\Delta V &= R_{eff}I\\\\\n\\therefore I&=\\frac{\\Delta V}{R_{eff}}=\\frac{(12 {\\rm V})}{(6 {\\rm \\Omega})}=2 {\\rm A}\n\nThis current is the same that traverses each individual resistor, since it is the same as the current that goes through the battery. Referring back to the full circuit (\n\nFigure 7), we can now use Ohm’s Law to calculate the voltage drop across each resistor, since we know the current through each resistor. The voltage across the 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor is given by:\\Delta V_{2\\Omega}=RI=(2 {\\rm \\Omega})(2 {\\rm A})=4 {\\rm V}\n\nand the voltage across the 4 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor is given by:\\Delta V_{4\\Omega}=RI=(4 {\\rm \\Omega})(2 {\\rm A})=8 {\\rm V}\n\nNote that the sum of these two voltages is equal to the voltage increase across the battery, by conservation of energy. Consider the electric potential at different points in \n\nFigure 7 as you move clockwise around the loop starting at point {\\rm a}. If the electric potential is defined to be 0 {\\rm V} at the negative end of the battery (points {\\rm a} and {\\rm e}), the potential at point {\\rm d} (between the resistors) is the potential at point {\\rm e} plus the potential difference across the 4 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor:V_d = V_e+\\Delta V_{4\\Omega}=(0 {\\rm V})+(\\Delta V_{4\\Omega})=8 {\\rm V}\n\nIf we then add the potential difference across the 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor to the potential at point {\\rm d}, we find  that the potential at point {\\rm c} is V_c=V_d+\\Delta V_{2\\Omega}=12 {\\rm V}, as expected, since this corresponds to the potential at the positive terminal of the battery.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we showed how one can model a circuit by combining resistors together into effective resistors to simplify the circuit. We also showed how the potential differences across different components in a circuit must add up to zero (the voltage drops across the resistors must sum to the voltage increase across the battery).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat is the voltage across the combination of a 3 {\\rm V} battery connected in series with a 6 {\\rm V} battery, where the negative terminal of the 6 {\\rm V} battery faces the positive terminal of the 3 {\\rm V} battery?\n\n9 {\\rm V}.\n\n6 {\\rm V}.\n\n3 {\\rm V}.\n\n0 {\\rm V}.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/circuits#the-ideal-battery-in-a-circuit","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl3":"The real battery in a circuit","lvl2":"Batteries and simple circuits"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/circuits#the-real-battery-in-a-circuit","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl3":"The real battery in a circuit","lvl2":"Batteries and simple circuits"},"content":"So far, we have modelled batteries as “ideal” devices that provide a fixed potential difference. In reality, this neglects the fact that the materials that make the battery will themselves have a resistance. For example, if electrons want to leave the zinc rod in the electric cell illustrated in \n\nFigure 1, they will lose some energy as they pass through the zinc. Thus, when modelling a real battery in a circuit, it is important to include its “internal resistance”, as a resistor in series with the potential difference. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 9, which shows the two terminals of a real battery, an ideal battery (with a fixed potential difference, \\Delta V_{ideal}), and its internal resistance, r (which can be drawn on either side of the battery).\n\n\n\nFigure 9:Model of a real battery, showing an ideal battery in series with a resistor to model the internal resistance of the battery.\n\nIt is important to note that the potential difference across the terminals of the real battery is only equal to the potential difference across the ideal battery if there is no current flowing through the battery. If there is a current, I, flowing through the internal resistance, the electric potential will decrease by an amount Ir across the internal resistance, and the voltage across the real terminals will be \\Delta V_{ideal}-Ir.\n\nExample 19.2\n\nWhen no resistance is connected across a real battery, the potential difference across its terminals is measured to be 6 {\\rm V}. When an R=2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor is connected across the battery, a current of 2 {\\rm A} is measured through the resistor. What is the internal resistance, r, of the battery, and what is the voltage across its terminals when the R=2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor is connected?\n\nSolution\n\nThe real battery can be modelled as an ideal battery with potential difference, \\Delta V_{ideal}, in series with an internal resistance, r. While we do not know the value of the internal resistance, we are told that the potential difference across the terminals of the real battery is 6 {\\rm V} when no current flows through it. Since no current flows through the internal resistance, the voltage does not drop across the internal resistance, and the voltage across the terminals of the real battery (e.g. \n\nFigure 9) must thus be equal to the voltage across the terminals of the ideal battery, so that \\Delta V_{ideal}=6 {\\rm V}.\n\nWith this information, we can make a circuit diagram for the case when the 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor is connected across the terminals of the real battery, as in \n\nFigure 10.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A circuit showing a real battery (with internal resistance r) in series with a resistor.\n\nThe terminals of the real battery are located at points {\\rm a} and {\\rm c} of the diagram, whereas the terminals of the ideal battery correspond to points {\\rm a} and {\\rm b}. When no current flows through the internal resistor, r, there is no voltage drop across that resistor and the potential at {\\rm b} will be equal to the potential at {\\rm c}, as we argued above.\n\nThe circuit in \n\nFigure 10 is now identical to that analyzed in \n\nExample 19.1, and can be treated the same way. We can combine the 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor with the internal resistance, r, in series to obtain an effective resistor, R_{eff}=r+R. The voltage drop across the effective resistor will be the same as the potential difference across the ideal battery, and we can make use of Ohm’s Law to find the internal resistance, r:\\Delta V_{ideal}&= R_{eff}I=(r+R)I\\\\\n\\therefore r &= \\frac{\\Delta V_{ideal}}{I}-R=\\frac{(6 {\\rm V})}{(2 {\\rm A})}-(2 {\\rm \\Omega})=1 {\\rm \\Omega}\n\nNow that we know the internal resistance, we can determine the voltage drop across the internal resistor, using Ohm’s Law:\\Delta V_r = rI=(1 {\\rm \\Omega})(2 {\\rm A})=2 {\\rm V}\n\nThe voltage drop across the real terminals of the battery (between points {\\rm a} and {\\rm c}), is thus given by:\\Delta V_{real}=\\Delta V_{ideal}-\\Delta V_r=(6 {\\rm V})-(2 {\\rm V})=4 {\\rm V}\n\nAgain, you can verify that the voltage drops across the two resistors will sum to the total voltage drop across the terminals of the ideal battery.\n\nDiscussion: Modelling real batteries is not so different from modelling ideal batteries, since one only needs to include an internal resistance into the circuit. The key difference with a real battery is that the voltage across its real terminals depends on what is connected to the battery. In the example above, the battery has a voltage of 6 {\\rm V} across its (real) terminals when nothing is connected, but the voltage drops to 4 {\\rm V} when a 2 {\\rm \\Omega} resistor is connected.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nSuppose that you would like to measure the ideal voltage of a real battery by connecting a measurement device (a voltmeter) across its terminals.

Once you have identified a specific loop, if you trace a closed path around the loop, the electric potential must be the same at the end of the path as at the beginning of the path (since it is literally the same point in space). This means that if there is a voltage drop along the path (e.g. due to one or more resistors), then there must be equivalent voltage increases somewhere else on the path (e.g. due to one or more batteries). If this were not the case, it would be possible to have a path where charges could gain a net amount of energy by going around that path, which they could keep doing indefinitely and create an infinite amount of energy; instead, if charges gain potential energy in a battery, they must then lose exactly the same amount of energy inside one or more resistors along the path.\n\nFigure 14 shows a loop (which could be part of a larger circuit) to which we can apply the loop rule. The loop contains two batteries, facing in opposite directions (which would not normally be a good use of batteries), as illustrated by the battery arrows.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:A loop with 2 batteries and 3 resistors.\n\nThe procedure for applying the loop rule is as follows:\n\nIdentify the loop, including starting position and direction.\n\nStart at the beginning of the loop, and trace around the loop.\n\nEach time a battery is encountered, add the battery voltage if you are tracing the loop in the same direction as the corresponding battery arrow, subtract the voltage otherwise.\n\nEach time a resistor is encountered, subtract the voltage across that resistor (RI, from Ohm’s Law) if tracing the loop in the same direction as the current, add the the voltage otherwise.\n\nOnce you have traced back to the starting point, the resulting sum must be zero.\n\nTo illustrate the procedure, we trace out the loop {\\rm abcedfga} in \n\nFigure 14. We thus start at point {\\rm a} and trace the loop in the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nBetween points {\\rm a} and {\\rm b} we encounter a battery, and we are tracing in the opposite direction of that battery’s arrow, so we subtract the voltage from that battery: -\\Delta V_1.\n\nBetween points {\\rm b} and {\\rm c}, we encounter a battery, and we are tracing in the same direction as that battery’s arrow, so we add the voltage from that battery: +\\Delta V_2.\n\nNothing happens to the potential along the wire from {\\rm c} to {\\rm d}.\n\nBetween points {\\rm d} and {\\rm e}, we encounter a resistor, and we are tracing in the same direction as the current through that resistor, so subtract the voltage across that resistor: -R_1I).\n\nSimilarly, we subtract the voltages across resistors R_2 and R_3, as we are tracing in the same direction as the current through those resistors: -IR_2-IR_3.\n\nWe are back at the beginning of the loop, so the terms must sum to zero.\n\nWe can now use the loop rule, which states that the sum of the above voltages must be zero:-\\Delta V_1 + \\Delta V_2 - R_1I - R_2I - R_3I = 0\\quad \\text{(loop abcdefga)}\n\nThis equation then gives us a relation between the various quantities (current, resistors, battery voltages) in the circuit which can be used to model the circuit.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nSuppose that the equation describing loop {\\rm abcdefga} (\n\nFigure 14) was obtained from a different starting position and the loop was traced in the opposite direction.

Imagine that the circuit in \n\nFigure 14 operates like a roller coaster, as shown in \n\nFigure 15. Each battery is like the mechanical lift that brings the cart to the top of the hill. The battery arrow points in the uphill direction.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:The circuit from \n\nFigure 14 using the roller coaster analogy.\n\nThis time, we’ll start at point {\\rm b} and go counter clockwise. In this analogy, Kirchhoff’s loop rule says that when the roller coaster cart comes back around to {\\rm b}, it needs to have the same gravitational potential it started with (since it will be at the same elevation). Let’s follow its journey around the loop. It starts at {\\rm b}, then goes through a battery and gets lifted uphill. The cart moves along the track (in the direction of the current) and loses potential energy whenever it goes down a hill (meaning through a resistor). When the cart comes around the left side of the circuit, it encounters another battery. This time, the cart is moving opposite to the battery arrow, so the cart goes downhill instead of getting lifted uphill. When it gets back to {\\rm b}, it has the same potential it started with. Note that, if we are moving in the direction opposite to the current, this is like going backwards through the roller coaster. Instead of going downhill through each resistor, you would have to go uphill, and thus gain potential energy.","type":"content","url":"/circuits#loop-rule","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Applying Kirchhoff’s rules to model circuits"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/circuits#applying-kirchhoffs-rules-to-model-circuits","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Applying Kirchhoff’s rules to model circuits"},"content":"In this section, we show how to model a circuit using Kirchhoff’s rules. In general, one can consider a circuit to be fully modelled if one can determine the current in each segment of the circuit.

The procedure is as follows:\n\nMake a good diagram of the circuit.\n\nSimplify any resistors that can easily be combined into effective resistors (in series or in parallel).\n\nMake a new diagram with the effective resistors, showing battery arrows, and labelling all of the nodes so that loops can easily be described.\n\nMake a guess for the directions of the current in each segment.\n\nWrite the junction rule equations.\n\nWrite the loop equations.\n\nThis will lead to N independent equations that one can solve for the N different currents in the circuit.\n\nOnce you have determined all of the currents, if some of them are negative numbers, switch the direction of those currents in the diagram (they will be negative if you guessed the direction incorrectly).\n\nWe will illustrate the procedure on the circuit shown in \n\nFigure 16, for which we would like to know the current through each resistor and each battery. The circuit contains 5 resistors (R_1-R_5), 2 real batteries (with ideal voltages \\Delta V_1 and \\Delta V_2), and 2 additional resistors to model the internal resistances of the real batteries (r_1, r_2)\n\n\n\nFigure 16:A circuit that can be simplified and then solved with Kirchhoff’s rules.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nHow many different currents are in the circuit shown in \n\nFigure 16?\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nSimplifying the resistors (step 2): In this circuit, resistors r_2, R_1 and R_2 are in series, so that they can be combined into an effective resistor, R_6:R_6=r_2+R_1+R_2\n\nWith this simplification, we obtain the circuit illustrated in \n\nFigure 17\n\n\n\nFigure 17:The resistors r_2, R_1 and R_2 in series from the circuit in \n\nFigure 16 have been combined into the effective resistor, R_6, to simplify the circuit.\n\nNext, we note that resistors R_4 and R_5 are in parallel and can be easily combined into a resistor, R_7:R_7=\\frac{R_4R_5}{R_4+R_5}\n\nwhich leads to the circuit illustrated in \n\nFigure 18.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:The resistors R_4 and R_5 in parallel from the circuit in \n\nFigure 17 have been combined into the effective resistor, R_7, to simplify the circuit.\n\nFinally, we note that r_1 and R_7 are in series and can be combined into an effective resistor, R_8:R_8=r_1+R_7=r_1+\\frac{R_4R_5}{R_4+R_5}\n\nleading to the simplified circuit illustrated in \n\nFigure 19, which we have labelled with nodes and battery labels.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:The resistors r_1 and R_7 from the circuit in \n\nFigure 18 have been combined into an effective resistor, R_8, to simplify the circuit.\n\nGuessing the directions of the currents (step 4): Before we can write the equations from Kirchhoff’s rules, we need to label the currents in the circuit diagram. In general, it is not always obvious in which way the currents will go, so we make a guess that we can fix later if we guessed wrong.\n\nIn order to guess the current directions, choose one point on the circuit and move along a segment. Label the current in that segment and continue moving through the circuit, splitting up the current when a junction is encountered. Make sure to only have one current per segment. We guess the currents as follows, referring to \n\nFigure 20:\n\nWe start at point {\\rm a} and move upwards to point {\\rm f}. We will call the current in that segment, I_1.\n\nSince there is no junction, the current I_1 continues through the resistor R_8 to point {\\rm e}.\n\nThere is a junction at point {\\rm e}, so we split the current I_1 into currents I_2 (towards point {\\rm d}), and I_3 (downwards to point {\\rm b}).\n\nWe follow current I_2 first; I_2 flows from {\\rm e} to {\\rm d}, then down to {\\rm c}, through the battery \\Delta V_2, and to point {\\rm b}, where there is again junction.\n\nWe follow current I_3, which just flows down to the junction at point {\\rm b}, where it “meets up” with current I_2.\n\nCurrents I_2 and I_3 both flow into the junction at point {\\rm b}, and the current flowing out of the junction, through the battery \\Delta V_1, and towards point {\\rm a} is, again, I_1, since this current then flows up to point {\\rm f}.\n\nAll segments of wire have a labelled current, so we are done guessing currents.\n\nYou can proceed in an analogous way for any circuit. The final circuit, with currents labelled, is shown in \n\nFigure 20:\n\n\n\nFigure 20:Final and labelled circuit diagram that is simplified from the one in \n\nFigure 16.\n\nWe can now proceed using Kirchhoff’s rules to solve for the values of the currents in the circuit. It is useful to note that there are 3 unknown currents in this circuit; we thus hope that Kirchhoff’s rules will give us 3 independent equations.\n\nApplying the junction rule (step 5): In the circuit from \n\nFigure 20, there are two junctions (at points {\\rm b} and {\\rm e}), so we will get two equations from the junction rule. To apply the junction rule, the sum of the currents coming into the junction must be equal to the currents going out of the junction:\\text{incoming currents}&=\\text{outgoing currents}&\\\\\nI_2+I_3 &= I_1 \\quad &\\text{(junction b)}\\\\\nI_1 &= I_2+I_3 \\quad &\\text{(junction e)}\\\\\n\nNote that the two equations are not independent (in fact, they are the same). It is generally the case that if there N junctions, one will obtain less than N independent equations (usually, N-1 equations will be independent). In this case, the two junctions only gave us one equation.\n\nApplying the loop rule (step 6): This circuit contains 3 different loops: {\\rm abcdefa}, {\\rm abefa}, and {\\rm bcdeb}, which will lead to 3 equations from the loop rule. We expect that these equations will not be independent, since this would lead to 4 equations and 3 unknowns when combined with the junction rule equation. Let us start with the loop {\\rm abcdefa}:\n\nFrom {\\rm a} to {\\rm b}, we trace through the battery in the opposite direction from the battery arrow: -\\Delta V_1.\n\nFrom {\\rm b} to {\\rm c}, we trace through the battery in the same direction as the battery arrow: +\\Delta V_2.\n\nFrom {\\rm c} through {\\rm d} and through to {\\rm e} we go through the resistor R_6 in the opposite direction from the current, I_2, in that resistor: +I_2R_6.\n\nFrom {\\rm e} to {\\rm f}, we go through the go through the resistor R_8 in the opposite direction from the current, I_1, in that resistor: +I_1R_8.\n\nAnd we are back at the starting point, so the sum of the above terms is equal to zero.\n\nwhich gives the equation:-\\Delta V_1+\\Delta V_2+I_2R_6+I_1R_8=0\\quad\\text{(loop abcdefa)}\n\nSimilarly, for the loop {\\rm abefa}, we obtain:-\\Delta V_1+I_3R_3+I_1R_8=0\\quad\\text{(loop abefa)}\n\nand for loop {\\rm bcdeb}:\\Delta V_2+I_2R_6-I_3R_3=0\\quad\\text{(loop bcdeb)}\n\nAlthough it appears that we have obtained 3 additional equations, only two of these are independent. For example, if you sum the second and third equations (loops {\\rm abefa}, and {\\rm bcdeb}), you simply obtain the first equation (loop {\\rm abcdefa}). In general, if there are N different loops, one will obtain less than N independent equations (usually N-1 independent equations, as we did here).\n\nAt this point, after choosing one of the junction equations, and two of the loop equations, we have 3 independent equations that we can solve for the 3 unknown currents\\footnote{The 3 unknowns do not necessarily have to be the currents, and could be any combination of the currents, battery voltage and resistors. As long as there at most 3 unknown quantities, this circuit can be solved.}:I_1 &= I_2+I_3 \\quad &\\text{(junction e)}\\\\\n-\\Delta V_1+\\Delta V_2+I_2R_6+I_1R_8&=0\\quad&\\text{(loop abcdefa)}\\\\\n-\\Delta V_1+I_3R_3+I_1R_8&=0\\quad&\\text{(loop abefa)}\n\nIt is only a matter of some simple math to solve for the 3 unknowns from these 3 equations (which we carry out in the example below).\n\nExample 19.3\n\nReferring to the circuit in \n\nFigure 21, what is the voltage across the real terminal of the battery with ideal voltage \\Delta V_1 (the voltage between points {\\rm a} and {\\rm b})? What is the current through resistor R_5?\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nFigure 21:The same circuit as in \n\nFigure 16, with values filled in.\n\nSince this circuit is the same that we just analyzed, we know that it can be simplified into the circuit shown in \n\nFigure 22, with resistors:R_6&=r_2+R_1+R_2=(1 {\\rm \\Omega})+(3 {\\rm \\Omega})+(4 {\\rm \\Omega})=8 {\\rm \\Omega}\\\\\nR_8&=r_1+\\frac{R_4R_5}{R_4+R_5}=(1 {\\rm \\Omega})+\\frac{(2 {\\rm \\Omega})(2 {\\rm \\Omega})}{(2 {\\rm \\Omega})+(2 {\\rm \\Omega})}=2 {\\rm \\Omega}\n\n\n\nFigure 22:Simplified version of the circuit in \n\nFigure 21.\n\nFrom above, we know that this leads to the following three equations:I_1 &= I_2+I_3 \\quad &\\text{(junction e)}\\\\\n-\\Delta V_1+\\Delta V_2+I_2R_6+I_1R_8&=0\\quad&\\text{(loop abcdefa)}\\\\\n-\\Delta V_1+I_3R_3+I_1R_8&=0\\quad&\\text{(loop abefa)}\n\nIn order to solve these types of equations, it is usually convenient to place the battery voltages on the right hand side, and the resistor voltages on the left hand side. Although it is generally bad practice to fill numbers into the equations before solving them, it is almost always a good idea when solving the N equations for the N currents. Furthermore, in order to make the equations legible, it is also useful to not write in the units (which is very bad practice in general!). Thus, filling in the values for the resistors and the battery voltages, moving the voltages to the right hand side, we obtain the following system of equations:I_1-I_2-I_3&=0  \\quad &\\text{(junction e)}\\\\\n2I_1+8I_2&=8 \\quad&\\text{(loop abcdefa)}\\\\\n2I_1+4I_3&=12 \\quad&\\text{(loop abefa)}\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation (to eliminate I_1):4I_3-8I_2&=4\\\\\n\\therefore I_3&=1+2I_2\n\nSubstituting this into the junction equation:I_1-I_2-I_3&=0\\\\\nI_1-I_2-1-2I_2&=0\\\\\n\\therefore I_2=\\frac{1}{3}(I_1-1)\n\nFinally, substituting this into the equation from loop {\\rm abcdefa}, allows us to determine I_1 and the other two currents:2I_1+8I_2&=8\\\\\n2I_1+8\\left(\\frac{1}{3}(I_1-1) \\right)&=8\\\\\n\\therefore I_1&=\\frac{16}{7}=2.29 {\\rm A}\\\\\n\\therefore I_2&=\\frac{1}{3}(I_1-1)=0.43 {\\rm A}\\\\\n\\therefore I_3&=1+2I_2=1.86 {\\rm A}\\\\\n\nIn this case, the currents are all positive, so the diagram in \n\nFigure 22 is correct and we do not need to reverse the direction of any of the currents.\n\nWe can now determine the potential difference across the real terminals of the battery \\Delta V_1. The current through the battery is I_1=2.29 {\\rm A}, which cause a voltage drop, \\Delta V_{r1}, across its internal resistance, r_1 of:\\Delta V_{r1}=I_1r_1=(2.29 {\\rm A})(1 {\\rm \\Omega})=2.29 {\\rm V}\n\nThe voltage across the real terminals of the battery is then:\\Delta V_{real}=\\Delta V_1-\\Delta V_{r1}=(12 {\\rm V})-(2.29 {\\rm V})=9.7 {\\rm V}\n\nThe current through the resistor R_5 (\n\nFigure 21) requires a little more thought, since we calculated the current, I_1 through the effective resistor R_8, which we must now “break apart”. \n\nFigure 23 shows the components of R_8.\n\n\n\nFigure 23:The components of the effective R_8 resistor from \n\nFigure 22. The current, I_1, coming from the battery goes through r_1 and then splits up.\n\nThe current I_1, that goes through the \\Delta V_1 battery also goes through the r_1 internal resistance of the battery. That current then splits up into currents, I_4 and I_5, to go through the resistors R_4 and R_5. Although it should be obvious that half of I_1 will go through each resistor (since these are equal), we can determine this from applying Kirchhoff’s rules to the combination of resistors in \n\nFigure 23:I_1&=I_4+I_5 \\quad&\\text{(junction)}\\\\\nI_5R_5-I_4R_4&=0\\quad&\\text{(clockwise loop)}\n\nFrom the loop equation, we have:I_5=\\frac{R_4}{R_5}I_4=I_4\n\nsince R_4=R_5=2 {\\rm \\Omega}. Since I_4=I_5, the junction equation gives:I_5=\\frac{1}{2}I_1=1.15 {\\rm A}\n\nBy solving for I_4 and I_5, we have now determined all of the currents through all of the segments of the original circuit in \n\nFigure 21.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we showed how one can use a simplified circuit to solve the current through the effective resistors in the simplified circuit. Once those currents are known, we showed that it is straightforward to determine the currents through individual resistors that have been combined into effective resistors.\n\nJosh’s Thoughts\n\nSolving a circuit can be daunting, especially if the diagram is drawn in an unfamiliar  way. While the circuits in this chapter are designed to be as easy to read as possible, many circuits are much more strange. For example, here is a circuit which you may come across:\n\n\n\nFigure 24:A weird looking circuit.\n\nThe circuit in \n\nFigure 24 May look like it is a difficult circuit to solve, but the diagram can be re-drawn to reveal the simplicity of the circuit:\n\n\n\nFigure 25:A much less weird looking circuit.\n\nWhat used to be a strange kite shape is now just a parallel circuit, which can be further simplified by calculating the effective resistance:R_{eff} &= (R_1^{-1}+R_2^{-1}+(R_3+R_4)^{-1})^{-1}\n\nWhich gives a series circuit with only one resistor:\n\n\n\nFigure 26:A simple circuit.\n\nCircuits can be drawn in many unique or potentially confusing ways, but knowing how to read the circuit and re-draw it can help make the diagram more legible and the circuit easier to solve.","type":"content","url":"/circuits#applying-kirchhoffs-rules-to-model-circuits","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Measuring current and voltage"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/circuits#measuring-current-and-voltage","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Measuring current and voltage"},"content":"In this section, we describe how one can build devices to measure current and voltage.

The circuit, with the voltmeter connected, is shown in \n\nFigure 31.\n\n\n\nFigure 31:When using a voltmeter, the circuit is modified.\n\nWe can model this circuit quite easily by combining the voltmeter (modelled as a resistor) in parallel with one of the resistors:R_{eff}&=\\frac{R_VR}{R_V+R}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(10 {\\rm k\\Omega})(1 {\\rm k\\Omega})}{(10 {\\rm k\\Omega})+(1 {\\rm k\\Omega})}\\\\\n&=\\frac{10}{11}{\\rm k\\Omega}=0.91 {\\rm k\\Omega}\n\nThe sum of the voltage drops across the effective resistor and the other resistor must equal the potential difference across the battery (Kirchhoff’s loop rule):R_{eff}I+RI&=\\Delta V\\\\\n\\therefore I &= \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_{eff}+R}=\\frac{(12 {\\rm V})}{(0.91 {\\rm k\\Omega})+(1 {\\rm k\\Omega})}=6.29e-3 {\\rm A}\n\nThe voltage drop across the effective resistor is the same as the reading on the voltmeter:\\Delta V_{voltmeter}=IR_{eff}=(6.29e-3 {\\rm A})(0.91 {\\rm k\\Omega})=5.7 {\\rm V}\n\nand the voltmeter reads a smaller voltage than there would be without the voltmeter.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we saw that by using a voltmeter to measure a voltage in a circuit, we actually disturb the circuit. By placing the voltmeter in parallel with one resistor, we created an effective resistor with a resistance that is lower than the resistance of either the voltmeter or the resistor. This lowered the total resistance of the circuit, which increased the current. A larger current through the second resistor (without the voltmeter) leads to a larger voltage drop than 6 {\\rm V} across that resistor. Thus, the voltage drop across the resistor with the voltmeter will be less than 6 {\\rm V}, as we found, since the two voltage drops need to add to 12 {\\rm V}. In general, when using a voltmeter, one needs a voltmeter with a very high resistance in order to minimize the disturbance to the circuit (if the voltmeter has a high resistance, only a small amount of current will be shunted from the resistor). In practice, voltmeters have resistance that are typically of the order of 1 {\\rm M\\Omega}.","type":"content","url":"/circuits#the-voltmeter","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Modelling circuits with capacitors"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/circuits#modelling-circuits-with-capacitors","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Modelling circuits with capacitors"},"content":"\\begin{review}\n* Section \\ref{sec:potential:capacitors} on capacitors.\n\n\\end{review}\nSo far, we have modelled circuits where the current does not change with time. When a capacitor is included in a circuit, the current will change with time, as the capacitor charges or discharges. The circuit shown in \n\nFigure 32 shows an ideal battery\\footnote{The model still holds for a real battery, since the internal resistance of the battery can just be included into the resistance of the resistor, R.} (\\Delta V), in series with a resistor (R), a capacitor (C, two vertical bars) and a switch ({\\rm S}) that is open.\n\n\n\nFigure 32:A simple circuit with a resistor, battery, and capacitor.\n\nWhen the switch is open, current cannot flow through the circuit. If we assume that the capacitor has no charge on it, once we close the switch, current will start to flow and charges will accumulate on the capacitor. Electrons will leave the negative terminal of the battery, flow through the resistor and accumulate on the left side of the capacitor, which acquires a negative charge. This pushes electrons off of the right hand side of the capacitor, which then becomes positively charged. The electrons from the positive side of the capacitor then flow into the positive side of the battery, completing the circuit.\n\nEventually, the charges on the capacitor will build up to a point were they prevent any further flow of current. Once the left side of the capacitor is at the same potential as the left side of the battery, current will cease to flow. That is, eventually, the potential difference across the capacitor will be equal to that across the battery, and we can think of this as a circuit used to charge a capacitor. The current is high when the switch is first opened, but eventually goes down to zero as the capacitor charges. The current is thus time-dependent.\n\nWe can model this simple circuit (with the switch closed) using Kirchhoff’s loop rule. The sum of the voltages across each component must sum to zero:\\Delta V - IR - \\frac{Q}{C} = 0\n\nwhere we used the fact that the charge, Q, on a capacitor is related to the potential difference, \\Delta V_C, across the capacitor by Q=C\\Delta V_C. The current, I, is the rate at which charges flow through the circuit, and is thus equal to rate at which charges accumulate on the capacitor:I=\\frac{dQ}{dt}\n\nSubstituting this into the loop equation, we obtain a separable differential equation for the charge on the capacitor as a function of time, Q(t):\\Delta V - IR - \\frac{Q}{C} &= 0\\\\\n\\Delta V - \\frac{dQ}{dt}R - \\frac{Q}{C} &= 0\\\\\n\\Delta V - \\frac{Q}{C} &= \\frac{dQ}{dt}R\\\\\nC\\Delta V - Q &= RC\\frac{dQ}{dt}\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{dt}{RC}&=\\frac{dQ}{C\\Delta V - Q }\n\nThis is similar to differential equations that we have solved previously (in fact, it is the same equation as in \n\nExample 6.4 where we looked at the effect of velocity-dependent drag). The solution to the equation, assuming that the switch is closed at t=0, is given by an exponential:Q(t) = C\\Delta V\\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}} \\right)\n\nThus, the charge on the capacitor starts at zero when the switch is closed, and grows asymptotically until it reaches a value of Q=C\\Delta V, which corresponds to the capacitor having the same potential difference across it as the battery. The value \\tau=RC is called the “time constant” of the RC circuit, and corresponds to the time at which the capacitor will reach about (1-e^{-1})=63\\% of its maximal charge. The current as a function of time is given by:I(t)=\\frac{dQ}{dt}=\\frac{\\Delta V}{R}e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}\n\nand we can see that at time t=0 the current is the same as if there were no capacitor present, and the current then decreases exponentially until it reaches zero.","type":"content","url":"/circuits#modelling-circuits-with-capacitors","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/circuits#summary","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"Batteries are usually formed from a collection of electrochemical cells. Batteries provide a constant electric potential difference across their terminals, usually sustained by a chemical reaction, as long as the current through the battery is not too large (or the chemical reactions cannot be sustained).\n\nAn ideal battery has no resistance and can be modelled as a simple potential difference in a circuit. A real battery includes an internal resistance and be modelled in a circuit as an ideal battery in series with a resistor. The voltage across the terminals of a real battery is equal to the voltage across the terminals of the ideal battery only when no current flows through the internal resistance.\n\nCircuits are modelled using circuit diagram that include components (such as batteries and resistors) and wires. Wires are always modelled as having no resistance, since their resistance can be included by placing the appropriate resistor along the wire. The electric potential is always constant along a wire with no resistance. When modelling a circuit, one always models the direction of conventional current; that is, current is always indicated as the direction in which positive charges flow (even if in reality, it is negative electrons that flow in the opposite direction).\n\nCircuits should be thought of in terms of conservation of energy. Components produce a potential difference between sections of wire. Batteries correspond to an increase in potential (if going from the negative to the positive terminal), whereas resistors corresponds to a decrease in potential (if going in the same direction as current through the resistor).\n\nKirchhoff’s rules allow us to model complex circuits. The junction rule states that: The current entering a junction must be equal to the current exiting a junction. This is a statement about conservation of charge. If charges are flowing into a junction, then the same amount of charges must flow back out of the junction per unit time.\n\nThe loop rule states that: The net voltage drop across a loop must be zero. This is a statement about conservation of energy indicating that as the potential energy of a positive charge increases as it goes through a battery, it will decrease by the same amount if it goes through a resistor that is connected to the terminals of that battery.\n\nIn order to apply the loop rule, we strongly suggest using the following procedure, after having made a clear, labelled diagram showing battery arrows and currents in the circuit:\n\nIdentify the loop, including starting position and direction.\n\nStart at the beginning of the loop, and trace around the loop.\n\nEach time a battery is encountered, add the battery voltage if you are tracing the loop in the same direction as the corresponding battery arrow, subtract the voltage otherwise.\n\nEach time a resistor is encountered, subtract the voltage across that resistor (RI, from Ohm’s Law) if tracing the loop in the same direction as the current, add the the voltage otherwise.\n\nOnce you have traced back to the starting point, the resulting sum must be zero.\n\nIn general, we suggest the following procedure in order to use Kirchhoff’s rules to model any circuit:\n\nMake a good diagram of the circuit.\n\nSimplify any resistors that can easily be combined into effective resistors (in series or in parallel).\n\nMake a new diagram with the effective resistors, showing battery arrows, and labelling all of the nodes so that loops can easily be described.\n\nMake a guess for the directions of the current in each segment.\n\nWrite the junction rule equations. Usually, you will get M-1 independent equations for M loops.\n\nWrite the loop equations. Usually, you will get M-1 independent equations for M loops.\n\nThis will lead to N independent equations that one can solve for the N different currents in the circuit.\n\nOnce you have determined all of the currents, if some of them are negative numbers, switch the direction of those currents in the diagram (they will be negative if you guessed the direction incorrectly).\n\nCurrent and voltage measuring devices (ammeters and voltmeters, respectively) can be constructed from a galvanometer, which measures small currents. An ammeter is constructed by placing a small shunt resistor in parallel with the galvanometer so that most of the current passes through the shunt resistor. The resulting ammeter must be placed in series with a component in order to measure the current through that component.\n\nA voltmeter is constructed by placing a resistor in series with the galvanometer in order to reduce the current through the galvanometer. The resulting voltmeter must be placed in parallel with a component in a circuit in order to measure the voltage across that component. Note that because voltmeters and ammeters have a non-zero resistance, they will affect the circuit once they are connected.\n\nWhen a capacitor is placed in a circuit, the current in the circuit will no longer be constant in time. If an uncharged capacitor with capacitance, C, is placed in a series circuit with a battery and a resistor of resistance, R, the capacitor will charge until the voltage across the capacitor is equal to that across the battery. Once the capacitor is charged, current ceases to flow in the circuit. The charges on a capacitor accumulate with a rate that decays exponentially; it will take an infinite amount of time for the capacitor to become fully charged. It will be charged to about 63% of maximum charge after a period of time, \\tau=RC, called the time constant of the capacitor.\n\nImportant Equations\n\nOhm’s Law:\\Delta V &= IR\n\nJunction Rule:\\sum I_{in} &= \\sum I_{out}\n\nLoop Rule:\\sum_{loop} \\Delta V = 0","type":"content","url":"/circuits#summary","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Thinking about the material"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/circuits#thinking-about-the-material","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 19 - Electric circuits","lvl2":"Thinking about the material"},"content":"Reflect and research\n\nWhen did Galvani and Volta experiment with electric cells?\n\nWhat is the largest voltage that Volta obtained with his voltaic pile?\n\nHow does one charge a rechargeable battery?

In this case, the capacitor is discharging as a function of time. At time t=0, the voltage across the capacitor is \\Delta V=9 {\\rm V}. We can model this discharging circuit in a similar way as we modelled the charging circuit.\n\nWe start with Kirchhoff’s loop rule, which leads to a differential equation for the charge stored on the capacitor as function of time, Q(t):\\Delta V - IR &=0\\\\\n\\frac{Q}{C} - IR &=0\\\\\n\\frac{Q}{C} - \\frac{dQ}{dt}R &=0\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{dQ}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{RC}Q\n\nThis differential equation is straightforward to solve, since it says that the derivative of Q(t) is equal to a constant multiplied by Q(t). Thus, Q(t) must be an exponential function:Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}\n\nwhere Q_0 is the (unknown) charge on the capacitor at t=0. You can easily verify that taking the derivative of this equation will result in the differential equation being satisfied.\n\nNow that we have an equation for the charge as a function of time, it is straightforward to find the current, since it is just the time derivative of the charge. The current as a function of time, I(t), is given by:I &=\\frac{dQ}{dt}=-\\frac{1}{RC}Q=\\frac{Q_0}{RC} e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}=I_0e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}\n\nwhere I_0=\\frac{Q_0}{RC} is the current at t=0.\\\n\nWe also know that the current through the resistor at t=0 is given by Ohm’s Law, since, at that time, the voltage, \\frac{Q_0}{C}=9 {\\rm V}:I_0=\\frac{Q_0}{RC}=\\frac{(9 {\\rm V})}{(2 {\\rm \\Omega})}=4.5 {\\rm A}\n\nWe then know that the current, at time t=5 {\\rm s}, is equal to I(5)=0.05 {\\rm A}, allowing us to determine the capacitance:I(5)&=I_0e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}\\\\\n\\ln\\left( \\frac{I(5)}{I_0} \\right)&=-\\frac{t}{RC}\\\\\n\\therefore C&=\\frac{t}{R \\ln\\left( \\frac{I_0}{I(5)} \\right)}=\\frac{(5 {\\rm s})}{(2 {\\rm \\Omega})\\ln\\left( \\frac{(4.5 {\\rm A})}{(0.05 {\\rm A})} \\right)}=0.56 {\\rm F}\n\nb. To find the charge stored in the capacitor at t = 2 {\\rm s}, we can use the function Q(t) that we determined before:Q(t=2 {\\rm s})=Q_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}\n\nwhere we can determine Q_0, now that we know the capacitance. Q_0 is the charge on the capacitor at time t=0, when the voltage across the capacitor is 9 {\\rm V}:Q_0=C\\Delta V = (0.56 {\\rm F})(9 {\\rm V})=5.0 {\\rm C}\n\nAt t = 2 {\\rm s}, the charge on the capacitor is thus:Q(t = 2 {\\rm s})=(5.0 {\\rm C})e^{-\\frac{(2 {\\rm s})}{(2 {\\rm \\Omega})(0.56 {\\rm F})}}=0.84 {\\rm C}\n\nSolution 19.2\n\nIn order to know the voltage across one of the resistors, we need to determine the voltage that is across the battery. Once we have determined the voltage across the battery, the voltage across one of the resistors will just be half of that across the battery, since the two resistors have the same resistance.\n\nWe can model the circuit with the voltmeter in place, since we know the voltage across the parallel combination of the voltmeter and resistor (that voltage which is readout by the voltmeter). We can combine the voltmeter and one of the resistors into a an equivalent resistor, R_{eff}:R_{eff} &= \\frac{1}{R_V^{-1}+R^{-1}}\\\\\nR_{eff} &= \\frac{1}{(20 {\\rm k\\Omega})^{-1}+(2.5 {\\rm k\\Omega})^{-1}}\\\\\nR_{eff} &= 2.22 {\\rm k\\Omega}\\\\\n\nNow that we have the effective resistance as well as the voltage drop across that effective resistor, we can solve for current through the circuit:I &= \\frac{\\Delta V_{vm}}{R_{eff}}\\\\\nI &= \\frac{5.647 {\\rm V}}{2.22 {\\rm k\\Omega}}\\\\\nI &= 2.541 {\\rm mA}\\\\\n\nNow that we have the current, we can combine the known resistances and determine the voltage drop across the battery.\\Delta V_{battery} &= I(R_{eff}+R)\\\\\n\\Delta V_{battery} &= (2.541 {\\rm mA})(2.222 {\\rm k\\Omega}+2.5 {\\rm k\\Omega})\\\\\n\\Delta V_{battery} &= 12 {\\rm V}\\\\\n\nThus, with no voltmeter present, the voltage across each resistor is 6 {\\rm V}.","type":"content","url":"/circuits#solutions","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/magneticforce","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/magneticforce","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/magneticforce#chapter-magneticforce","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"This chapter introduces the tools to model the magnetic force, which is something that we have all experienced with magnets.

In your experience, every magnet that you have seen always has a “North” pole and a “South” pole. Most likely, you have noticed that the North pole of a magnet is attracted to the South pole of another magnet, and that the two North (or South) poles of different magnets repel each other. Thus, the magnetic force is attractive between two opposite poles, and repulsive otherwise.\n\nThe Earth itself can be modelled as a giant bar magnet, with North and South magnetic poles. The poles on a magnet are labelled North and South according to which geographic pole of the Earth they are attracted to (a magnetic compass needle has a magnetic North pole on the side that point to the Earth’s North geographic pole).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIs the magnetic North pole of the Earth located closer to the Earth’s geographic North pole or closer to its geographic South Pole?\n\nEarth does not have a magnetic field.\n\nEarth’s magnetic North pole is at Earth’s geographic North pole.\n\nEarth’s magnetic North pole is at Earth’s geographic South pole.\n\nEarth’s magnetic North pole depends on the charge of the observer.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nIt may seem that the magnetic force can be described in the same way as the electric force, having two opposite sign “charges” (or poles for magnets), although this is not the case. As far as we can tell, there are no magnets that have only a North or a South pole. Every magnet must have a North and a South pole. This is fundamentally different from the electric force, where an object can have a net positive or negative charge. In the context of magnetism, we say that “monopoles do not exist” (an object that has only a North or a South pole would be called a monopole). This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 1, which shows what happens as one cuts a bar magnet into two pieces; rather than ending up with a North and a South piece (monopoles), we end up with two smaller bar magnets, each with their own North and South pole.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:When a bar magnet is cut through the middle, one obtains two magnets, each with a North and South pole, rather than a North and a South magnet.\n\nWe model the magnetic force using a magnetic field vector, usually labelled \\vec B. The magnitude of the magnetic field has the S.I. units of Teslas (\\si{T}). We draw magnetic field lines in much the same way that we draw electric field lines. The magnetic field lines are such that the magnetic field vector, \\vec B, at some point in space is tangent to the field line at that point. The strength of the magnetic field is determined by the density of field lines at that position in space. The direction of the magnetic field, \\vec B, indicates the direction of the force that is exerted on the North pole of a magnet. Magnetic field lines thus flow away from North poles and towards South poles.\n\nThe magnetic field description is similar to that of the electric field, with North magnetic poles being similar to positive electric charges, and vice versa.  However, because magnetic monopoles do not exist, magnetic field lines do not end (or start) on the pole of a magnet. Rather, magnetic field lines must always form closed loops. \n\nFigure 2 shows the magnetic field lines for a bar magnet, highlighting that the field lines do not end at the poles, but rather continue through the magnet (and some of the lines only “close” outside of the figure). The magnetic field from a bar magnet is very similar to the electric field created by an electric dipole. For that reason, an object (such as a bar magnet) that forms magnetic field lines of this shape are often described as magnetic dipoles.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:The magnetic field lines for a bar magnet always form closed loops as they do not end at the North or South pole of the magnet.\n\nWe will discuss how to model magnetic fields in the next chapter, but it is important to understand that magnetic fields are created by moving electric charges. The electrons in the material that forms a bar magnet are the moving charges that create the magnetic field. As we will see, the magnetic field from a charge moving around in a circle (or a circular loop of current), has exactly the same shape as that of a bar magnet, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 3. We can thus think of charge moving in a circle as a small bar magnet, or more precisely, as a magnetic dipole.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:The magnetic field lines produced by a circular loop of current, I, are the same as those produced by a bar magnet.\n\nIn a magnet, the electrons in the material are moving in such a way that the magnetic fields that they generate are all in the same direction. In other words, each atom is like a small magnetic dipole, and all of these are aligned. This allows us to understand why cutting a magnet does not result in two monopoles (\n\nFigure 1): when we cut the bar magnet, we end up with less material, but each piece of material still contains magnetic dipoles that are aligned with each other, each having a North and South pole. Note that it is not the motion of electrons around their nuclei that results in the magnetic field, and that one  requires quantum mechanics and the notion of “spin” to describe this all in detail.\n\nMost materials will respond to magnetic fields, but the behaviour is most evident in “ferromagnetic” materials, such as iron (Fe). Ferromagnetic materials can be magnetized by an external magnetic field, effectively transforming them into magnets. One can think of a material as containing many little magnetic dipoles (from the motion of the electrons), which themselves are like bar magnets. If that material is ferromagnetic,  an external magnetic field can act on the little “bar magnets”, orienting them all in the same way, so that the material as a whole becomes magnetic. For some ferromagnetic materials, that common orientation will remain when the external magnetic field is removed, creating a “permanent magnet”. For other ferromagnetic materials, the common orientation disappears when the external field is removed; those materials are thus attracted to a magnet, but they cannot form a magnet.","type":"content","url":"/magneticforce#magnetic-fields","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"The magnetic force on a moving charge"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/magneticforce#the-magnetic-force-on-a-moving-charge","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"The magnetic force on a moving charge"},"content":"Review\n\nBefore proceeding, you may wish to review:\n\nSection 3.4.4 on the vector product.\n\nWhen an electric charge, q, has a velocity, \\vec v, relative to a magnetic field, \\vec B, a magnetic force is exerted on the particle:\\boxed{\\vec F_B = q \\vec v \\times \\vec B}\n\nWe can make a few remarks about the magnetic force:\n\nThe magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity and to the magnetic field (since it is given by their cross-product).\n\nThe direction of the magnetic force depends on the sign of the charge.\n\nThe magnetic force can do no work, since it is always perpendicular to the velocity (and thus to displacement).\n\nThere is no force if the particle’s velocity is in the same direction as the magnetic field vector.\n\nThe force increases with charge, speed, and strength of the magnetic field.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA proton moves East in Earth’s magnetic field, which way is it deflected?\n\nAway from the Earth.\n\nTowards the Earth.\n\nNorth.\n\nSouth.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\nAn electron moves West in Earth’s magnetic field, which way is it deflected?\n\nAway from the Earth.\n\nTowards the Earth.\n\nNorth.\n\nSouth.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nJosh’s Thoughts\n\n{}\nIt is very important to remember what each part of the right-hand rule for cross-products represents. To help remember what each finger represents, I say “velocity” as I extend my thumb, “field” as I extend my index finger, and “force” as I extend my middle finger. When using the right hand rule, it is also important to remember the q in the equation \\vec F_B = q\\vec v \\times \\vec B. This q could be negative, which would mean that the force acts in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:The way that Josh remembers the right hand rule for magnetism.\n\nIf you find yourself forgetting the right-hand rule on a test or exam, just remember that you can still find the correct answer by setting up a three-dimensional coordinate system and evaluating the cross product.\n\nYou should be somewhat bothered by the fact that the force depends on the velocity of the charge, since velocity depends on the frame of reference from which it is measured. The above equation has a strange implication: if we observe an electron moving in a magnetic field, we will see its motion be deflected by the magnetic field. If we move along with the electron, so that it has a velocity of zero in our frame of reference, we should not see the electron being deflected, since the magnetic force would be zero. Clearly, the motion of the electron cannot depend on the frame of reference from which we observe it. Thus, the only way that this equation can make sense is if the magnetic field also depends on our frame of reference. We will revisit this in a subsequent chapter, but for now, remember that this equation only makes sense if the velocity is measured in the same reference frame as that in which the magnetic field is defined.\n\nAnother bothersome issue with the magnetic force is that it appears to depend on the fact that most humans are right-handed. Indeed, the direction of the force requires one to use the right-hand rule, which appears arbitrary. This is a common occurrence in physics, as many quantities are defined using a cross-product. However, no physical quantity can ever depend on our choice of right or left hand for determining cross-products. It turns out that any physical quantity (such as the force on a particle, which will deflect the particle in a clearly identifiable direction that does not depends on a human’s choice of right and left), always depends on two successive applications of the right-hand rule. In this case, the direction of the magnetic field is also given by a right-hand rule applied to the moving charges that create the field (as we will see in the next chapter). The successive uses of the right hand twice “cancel”; one finds that a charge is deflected in the same direction if one had used the left hand to define the magnetic field, and then again the left-hand for the cross-product! We will revisit this issue in the next chapter.\n\nConsider the motion of a charged particle in a region where the magnetic field is uniform (constant in magnitude and direction). If the velocity vector of the particle is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the particle will undergo uniform circular motion, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:The motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field (out of the page) is uniform circular motion.\n\nIndeed, the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, and the force is constant in magnitude since both the speed and magnetic field remain constant. These are the only conditions required for uniform circular motion. We can easily determine the radius, R, of the circle, since the magnetic force is responsible for the centripetal acceleration:F_B &= m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\nqvB &= m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\\\\n\\therefore R &= \\frac{mv}{qB}\n\nThe radius is called the “cyclotron radius”.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIs the particle illustrated in \n\nFigure 5 positively or negatively charged?\n\nThe particle is positively charged.\n\nThe particle is negatively charged.\n\nNot enough information to tell.\n\nThe particle has no charge.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nReferring to \n\nFigure 5, if the velocity of the particle is in the plane of the page (perpendicular to the magnetic field), as illustrated, the particle will undergo uniform circular motion. If the velocity of the particle has a component that is parallel to the magnetic field (for example a component coming out of the page, towards you), the particle will undergo “helical motion” (a spiral). The radius of the helix is determined by the component of the velocity, \\vec v_{\\perp}, that is perpendicular the magnetic field:\\therefore R &= \\frac{mv_{\\perp}}{qB}\n\nThe charged particle would also have a component of velocity towards you that is constant, resulting in the spiral motion illustrated in \n\nFigure 6. Note that the distance between two spirals (labelled h in the figure) is called the “pitch”, and is determined by the component of velocity that is parallel to the magnetic field, \\vec v_\\parallel, since that component is not affected by the magnetic force.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:The helical motion of a charged particle with a component of velocity parallel to the magnetic field. The distance, h, between spirals is called the “pitch”.\n\nExample 20.1\n\nA particle of unknown charge and unknown mass is observed to undergo uniform circular motion with a period, T, when travelling perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, B. What is the ratio of the particle’s charge to its mass, q/m?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can use the period of the motion to determine the speed of the particle in terms of the radius of the circular path:v = \\frac{2\\pi R}{T}\n\nand then use the equation for the cyclotron radius to relate this to the charge-to-mass ratio of the particle:R &= \\frac{mv}{qB}\\\\\n  &= \\frac{2\\pi R m}{qBT}\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{q}{m} &= \\frac{2\\pi}{BT}\n\nDiscussion: When a charged particle undergoes uniform circular motion in a magnetic field, the radius of the motion depends on the particle’s charge-to-mass ratio. This can often be used to measure the mass of, say, an ion, if the charge of the ion is known (usually one or two units of the electron charge). A mass spectrometer makes use of this principle in order to determine the composition of a sample. The sample is vaporized and ionized, the ions are then accelerated using an electric potential difference, before they undergo uniform circular motion. Ions of different masses (and same charge) will then undergo circular motion with different radii, which allows their masses to be determined, and thus the composition of the sample to be known.","type":"content","url":"/magneticforce#the-magnetic-force-on-a-moving-charge","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"The magnetic force on a current-carrying wire"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/magneticforce#the-magnetic-force-on-a-current-carrying-wire","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"The magnetic force on a current-carrying wire"},"content":"Review\n\nBefore proceeding, you may wish to review:\n\nSection 18.3 on the microscopic model of current.\n\nIn this section, we examine the force that is exerted by a magnetic field on a wire that carries electric current. Since a current is formed by moving charges, it is natural to expect that a wire that carries current will experience a force if immersed in a magnetic field.\n\nConsider a vertical wire with cross-sectional area, A, carrying current, I, upwards that is immersed in a uniform magnetic field, \\vec B, into the page, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 7. Inside the wire, on average, electrons have a drift velocity, \\vec v_d, in the downwards direction (since they move in the direction opposite to that of conventional current).\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A section of wire carries conventional current, I, upwards while being immersed in a uniform magnetic field, \\vec B, into the page. We introduce a vector, \\vec l, to represent a section of wire of length l carrying current in the direction of \\vec l.\n\nA single electron (with charge q=-e) will experience a magnetic force, \\vec F_e, given by:\\vec F_e = -e \\vec v_d \\times \\vec B\n\nas illustrated in \n\nFigure 7. A section of wire of length, l, will contain N=nAl drifting electrons, where n is the density of free electrons for the wire (the number of electrons per unit volume that are available to produce a current). Thus, the magnetic force on that section of wire will be N times the force on a single electron:\\vec F = N\\vec F_e = nAl (-e \\vec v_d \\times \\vec B)=-nAle \\vec v_d \\times \\vec B\n\nRecall the microscopic model of current to relate the drift velocity to the conventional current in the wire:I &= -nAev_d\n\nwhere the minus sign indicates that negative electrons flow in the opposite direction from the conventional current. We also introduce a vector, \\vec l, with a magnitude equal to the length of the section of wire, and a direction that is parallel to the conventional current (thus anti-parallel to the electron drift velocity). The force on the section of the length, l, of the wire is thus given by:\\vec F = -nAle \\vec v_d \\times \\vec B\\boxed{ \\vec F= I \\vec l \\times \\vec B}\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nIf you forget this formula, you can obtain it rather easily from \\vec F=q\\vec v\\times \\vec B. For simplicity, we assume velocity is constant, so that velocity is the displacement, \\vec l, per unit time. We can then rewrite the formula for the force as:\\vec F&=q\\vec v\\times \\vec B\\\\\n&=q\\frac{\\vec l}{t}\\times \\vec B\\\\\n&=\\frac{q}{t}\\vec l\\times \\vec B.\n\nIn the last line, I have rewritten the equation to highlight the charge per unit time q/t, which is just the (constant) current, I. Using the current, the equation becomes,\\vec F=I\\vec l\\times \\vec B,\n\nas we found previously. This is a less rigorous derivation than what we did above, but it is helpful if you just need to remind yourself of the formula.\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nFigure 8:A current carrying wire moving through a magnetic field.\n\nIn which direction does the magnetic force point on the current-carrying wire that is placed in the magnetic field between the poles of the horseshoe magnet shown in \n\nFigure 8?\n\nUp.\n\nDown.\n\nInto the page.\n\nOut of the page.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nNote that if the wire is not straight, then we can model the wire as being made of many infinitesimally short sections (\n\nFigure 9), of length dl, and sum the forces on those sections to get the total force on a section of length L:\\vec F = \\int_0^L I d\\vec l \\times \\vec B\n\n\n\nFigure 9:The magnetic force on a curved current-carrying wire is obtained by modelling the forces exerted on infinitesimal sections of wire, each with length d\\vec l, and summing together those forces to get the total force on the wire.\n\nExample 20.2\n\nA wire carrying current I is bent so as to have a semi-circular section with radius R, as shown in \n\nFigure 10. The wire is immersed in a uniform magnetic field, \\vec B, that is perpendicular to the plane of the wire, as shown. Using the given coordinate system, what is the net force on the wire?\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A current-carrying wire with a semi-circular section is immersed in a uniform magnetic field.\n\nSolution\n\nWe can model the wire as being made of three sections: a straight section carrying current in the positive y direction, a curved section, and another straight section carrying current in the negative y direction.\n\nConsider the first straight section, carrying current in the positive y direction. The force on that section of wire, by the right hand rule, will be towards the left (negative x direction):F_S &= I \\vec l \\times \\vec B\\\\\n&= I (l\\hat y) \\times (-B\\hat z)\\\\\n&= -IlB (\\hat y \\times \\hat z)\\\\\n&=-IlB\\hat x\n\nwhere l is the (unknown) length of that section of wire. The force exerted on the other straight section of wire will have the same magnitude, but the opposite direction (since the current, and thus the vector \\vec l, is in the opposite direction). Thus, the forces from the two straight sections of the wire cancel, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 11.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:The magnetic force on different sections of wire.\n\nIn order to calculate the force exerted on the semi-circular section, we need to add together the forces exerted on the infinitesimal sections of the wire that make up that section. Consider the magnetic force on the two infinitesimal sections illustrated in \n\nFigure 11. The x components of the forces will cancel, whereas the y components will add. Thus, by symmetry, we anticipate that the net force on the semi-circular section will be in the positive y direction.\n\nConsider the small force on the section of wire located at an angle, θ, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 11. We can write the vector d\\vec l as:d\\vec l = dl(\\sin\\theta\\hat x + \\cos\\theta \\hat y)\n\nThus, the infinitesimal force on that section of wire is given by:d\\vec F &= I d\\vec l \\times \\vec B \\\\\n&= I dl(\\sin\\theta\\hat x + \\cos\\theta \\hat y)\\times (-B\\hat z)\\\\\n&=-IBdl (\\sin\\theta\\hat x \\times \\hat z + \\cos\\theta \\hat y \\times \\hat z)\\\\\n&=-IBdl (-\\sin\\theta \\hat y + \\cos\\theta\\hat x) \\\\\n&= IBdl\\sin\\theta \\hat y - IBdL\\cos\\theta \\hat x\\\\\n& = dF_y\\hat y + dF_x \\hat x\n\nwhere, in the last line, we explicitly wrote out the x and y components of the infinitesimal force vector. In order to sum together these infinitesimal forces, it is most convenient to use the angle θ to identify each segment. d\\theta is related to dl, since dl is the length of the circle subtended by the infinitesimal angle d\\theta:dl = Rd\\theta\n\nSumming together all of the y components of the infinitesimal forces:F_y = \\int dF_y = \\int_0^\\pi IBR\\sin\\theta d\\theta=IBR \\int_0^\\pi\\sin\\theta d\\theta=2IBR\n\nNote that the x components sum to zero, as we predicted from symmetry:F_x = \\int dF_x = -\\int_0^\\pi IBR\\cos\\theta d\\theta=-IBR \\int_0^\\pi\\cos\\theta d\\theta=0\n\nThe net force on the wire is thus given by:\\vec F = 2IBR\\hat y\n\nDiscussion: In this example we found the magnetic force on a curved section of current-carrying wire. The calculation was simplified by symmetry arguments, as we could use the right hand rule to anticipate that the force would have no component in the x direction. This is because there is as much current flowing in the positive y direction as there is in the negative y direction, so that the corresponding forces cancel. There is however a net flow of charges in the positive x direction, leading to a net force in the positive y direction. As a corollary, the net magnetic force on any closed loop of current must be zero.","type":"content","url":"/magneticforce#the-magnetic-force-on-a-current-carrying-wire","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"The torque on a current-carrying loop"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/magneticforce#the-torque-on-a-current-carrying-loop","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"The torque on a current-carrying loop"},"content":"Review\n\nBefore proceeding, you may wish to review:\n\nSection 10.4 on torque.\n\nSection 4 on electric dipoles.\n\nAs noted in \n\nExample 20.2, the net magnetic force on any closed loop immersed in a uniform magnetic field is zero. Consider, for example, the current-carrying rectangular loop of height h and width w, immersed in a uniform magnetic field, \\vec B, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 12 (note that the field is not perpendicular to the plane of the loop, as it was in \n\nExample 20.2).\n\n\n\nFigure 12:A rectangular loop carrying counter-clockwise current in a uniform magnetic field.\n\nThe magnetic force on the two horizontal sections of the wire are zero, since the current is co-linear with the magnetic field along those sections.

The direction of the magnetic dipole moment vector is such that it is perpendicular to the surface defined by the loop. This leaves two possible directions, and the correct option is given by the right-hand rule for axial vectors; by curling the fingers in the direction of the current, the thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic dipole moment. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 13.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:The right hand rule for axial vectors is used to determine the direction of the magnetic dipole moment vector for a loop carrying current, I.\n\nIn terms of the magnetic dipole moment, the torque on a loop with magnetic dipole moment, \\vec \\mu, immersed in a magnetic field, \\vec B, is given by:\\boxed{\\vec \\tau = \\vec \\mu \\times \\vec B}\n\nThe magnitude of the torque is given by:\\tau =\\mu B \\sin\\theta\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the magnetic dipole moment and the magnetic field vectors.\n\nWe can verify that this formula gives the correct torque for the rectangular loop in \n\nFigure 12 that we calculated above.

That is, instead of drawing a loop carrying current, we can equivalently simply draw the associated magnetic dipole moment vector. This is useful because the magnetic dipole moment vector behaves in the same way as a bar magnet (with the tip of the arrow acting like a North pole). Indeed, a magnetic field will always create a torque that will try to align the magnetic dipole moment with the magnetic field, just as the needle of a compass experiences a torque if it is not aligned with the magnetic field of the Earth. The torque from the magnetic field is then zero when the magnetic dipole moment is parallel to the magnetic field (as the cross-product between co-linear vectors is zero).\n\nFigure 14 shows a way to visualize a current-carrying loop in a magnetic field using its magnetic dipole moment vector, \\vec \\mu.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Three loops of current with different orientations relative to a uniform magnetic field.

Equivalently, one can simply draw the magnetic dipole moment vector for each loop (perpendicular to the plane of the loop). For the top loop, the magnetic dipole moment is parallel to the magnetic field, so the magnetic field exerts no torque. For the middle loop, the magnetic dipole moment makes an angle θ with the magnetic field vector, so that the torque on that loop has a magnitude given by \\tau=\\mu B \\sin\\theta, and points into the page (clockwise rotation). The bottom loop makes an angle of -\\pi/2 with the magnetic field, which results in a torque in the counter-clockwise direction. In all cases, the torque is such that it always tries to align the magnetic dipole moment vector with the magnetic field, just as if the magnetic dipole moment were the needle of a compass.\n\nExample 20.3\n\nDetermine the magnetic dipole moment of the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom, if you assume that the electron is in a circular orbit with a radius of R=0.5 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm A}.\n\nSolution\n\nAs the electron orbits around the circle, it results in a circular loop of current, I.

As they move to the left through the slab, they also move upwards and “pile up” on that side of the slab. There will thus be an excess of negative charge on the top side of the slab, leading to an electric potential difference between the top and the bottom of the slab. This potential difference is called the “Hall potential”, \\Delta V_{Hall}. An equilibrium between the magnetic force and the electric force associated with the Hall potential is quickly reached, so that the Hall potential remains constant.\n\nIf we model the slab as two parallel plates, with a potential difference, \\Delta V_{Hall}, between them, the electric field in the slab is constant and given by:E= \\frac{\\Delta V_{Hall}}{w}\n\nThe equilibrium condition (that the electric force on an electron is equal to the magnetic force) is given by:F_E &= F_B\\\\\neE &= ev_dB\\\\\n\\frac{\\Delta V_{Hall}}{w} &= v_d B\\\\\n\\therefore \\Delta V_{Hall}&= v_d wB\n\nIf the drift velocity of electrons is known, then the Hall effect can be used to measure the strength of the magnetic field by simply measuring the Hall voltage. This is the most common way to measure the strength of a magnetic field (and the device to do so is called a Hall probe). Conversely, if the magnetic field is known, the Hall effect can be used to characterize the drift velocity of electrons and other microscopic quantities for the material from which the Hall probe is made.\n\nThe Hall effect allows us to determine that it is negative charges that flow, and not positive charges. Indeed, consider \n\nFigure 15, but replace the electrons with positive charges flowing to the right, which is equivalent as far as analysing the circuit goes. In this case, those positive charges will be deflected upwards. Thus, if positive charges flow, the top side of the Hall probe becomes positive, whereas it becomes negative if it is negative charges that flow. By measuring the sign of the Hall potential, one can show that it is electrons that flow in an electric current.","type":"content","url":"/magneticforce#the-hall-effect","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"Applications"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/magneticforce#applications","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl2":"Applications"},"content":"In this section, we briefly outline a few applications of the magnetic force.","type":"content","url":"/magneticforce#applications","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl3":"Velocity selector and mass spectrometer","lvl2":"Applications"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/magneticforce#velocity-selector-and-mass-spectrometer","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 20 - Magnetic force","lvl3":"Velocity selector and mass spectrometer","lvl2":"Applications"},"content":"In \n\nExample 20.1, we described how charged particles with different charge-to-mass ratios will undergo uniform circular motion with different radii, if they all have the same speed. This principle is used in mass spectrometers, which are devices that are able to detect trace amounts of matter in a sample. For example, when your bag gets swiped with a sticky tape at a security check at the airport, that piece of sticky tape is then analysed by a mass spectrometer.\n\nThe tape is vaporized in a way to ionize the atoms on the tape. The ions are then accelerated through an electric potential difference and then pass through a region with a magnetic field. The ions typically execute half of a circular orbit before being detected, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 16. The charge-to-mass ratio of the ions is determined from the radius of their orbit. Usually, their charge is either one or two times the electron charge, allowing their mass to be determined.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:Illustration of how a mass spectrometer can separate ions based on their charge-to-mass ratio. A detector is placed to measure the number of ions that appear at each radius, allowing the composition of a sample to be determined.\n\nIn order for the mass spectrometer to function as designed, it is important that all of the charged particles enter the region of magnetic field with the same speed. A velocity selector is a device that combines perpendicular electric and magnetic fields in order to select only particles of a certain speed, regardless of their mass. The velocity selector is illustrated in \n\nFigure 17\n\n\n\nFigure 17:Illustration of a velocity selector.

While there are some similarities with the electric field, the key difference in magnetism is that there are no “magnetic charges” (so-called monopoles), and magnets thus always have a North and a South pole. As a result, magnetic field lines never end and must always form closed loops. The magnetic field points in the direction of the force that would be exerted on the North pole of a magnet placed at that position.\n\nElectric charges can feel a force from a magnetic field only if they are moving relative to the frame of reference in which the magnetic field is described. If a charge, q, has velocity, \\vec v, in a magnetic field, \\vec B, it will feel a magnetic force given by:\\vec F_B =q \\vec v \\times \\vec B\n\nThe magnetic force can do no work, since it always acts in a direction perpendicular to the velocity (and thus to the displacement). The magnetic field acts in opposite directions for charges of opposite signs.\n\nIn a uniform magnetic field, a charged particle with charge, q, mass m, and velocity vector, \\vec v, perpendicular to a magnetic field, \\vec B, will undergo uniform circular motion, with a cyclotron radius, R, given by:R &= \\frac{mv}{qB}\n\nA straight wire of length, l, carrying current, I, will experience a magnetic force in a magnetic field, \\vec B:\\vec F_B = I \\vec l \\times \\vec B\n\nwhere the vector \\vec l points in the same direction as the current.\n\nIf the wire is curved (or the magnetic field changes direction along the wire), then we can integrate the force, d\\vec F, exerted on each infinitesimal section of wire with length, d\\vec l. Again, the direction of d\\vec l is in the same direction as the current in the wire. The infinitesimal force on an infinitesimal section of wire, is given by:d\\vec F = I d\\vec l \\times \\vec B\n\nA closed loop of wire carrying current will experience no net force in a uniform magnetic field. However, it will experience a torque, if the loop is not “aligned” with the magnetic field (the torque is zero if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the loop). We define the magnetic dipole moment, \\vec \\mu of a loop of wire carrying current, I, to be a vector with magnitude:\\mu = IA\n\nwhere A is the area enclosed by the loop. The magnetic dipole moment vector is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, and points in the direction given by the right-hand rule for axial vectors applied to the current (think of the current as rotating in the loop).\n\nThe torque from a magnetic field, \\vec B, exerted on a loop with a magnetic dipole moment, \\vec \\mu, is given by:\\vec \\tau = \\vec \\mu \\times \\vec B\n\nThe torque is zero when the magnetic dipole moment vector is parallel to the magnetic field vector (corresponding to the loop being “aligned” with the magnetic field). One can think of the magnetic dipole moment as a small bar magnet, or the needle of a compass, that always experiences a torque to align it with a magnetic field.\n\nWe can define the potential energy of a magnetic dipole moment in a magnetic field as:U= -\\vec \\mu \\cdot \\vec B = \\mu B \\cos\\theta\n\nThe Hall effect can be observed when current flows through a slab that is immersed in a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the slab. As the electrons move longitudinally through the slab, they will also be pushed to one side by the magnetic force, resulting in an excess of negative charge on that side. An electric potential difference (the “Hall potential”) is then established between the two sides of the slab (in the direction perpendicular to the motion of the electrons). The Hall potential is given by:\\Delta V_{Hall}&= v_d wB\n\nwhere w is the width of the slab in the perpendicular direction, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and v_d is the drift velocity of electrons. The most common use of the Hall effect is to build a Hall probe to measure magnetic fields. However, Hall probes can also measure the drift velocity of electrons and other microscopic properties. The sign of the Hall potential also indicates the sign of the charges moving in the slab.\n\nThere are many applications of the magnetic force in our daily lives, including electric motors, loudspeakers, cathode ray tubes, mass spectrometers, and galvanometers.\n\nImportant Equations\n\nMagnetic force on a moving charge:\\vec F_B &= q\\vec v\\times \\vec B\n\nMagnetic force on a current-carrying wire:\\vec F_B = I \\vec l \\times \\vec B\n\nCyclotron radius:R &= \\frac{mv}{qB}\n\nMagnetic dipole moment:\\mu = IA\n\nTorque on a magnetic dipole:\\vec \\tau &= \\vec \\mu \\times \\vec B\n\nImportant Definitions\n\nMagnetic field: A field used to model the magnetic force.

Note that the vector d\\vec B is perpendicular to the vector \\vec r (since it is the cross-product of \\vec r with another vector).

Note that, in general, d\\vec B will also have an x component (the x component was only 0 before because we chose d\\vec l to be at the top of the ring). When we sum together the magnetic field elements, the x and y components will cancel, so that we are left with the z component.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:As the wire element, d\\vec l, moves along the ring, the tip of corresponding magnetic field element vector, d\\vec B, describes a circle centred on the z axis. Thus, only the (negative) z component of d\\vec B will survive when these are all added together.\n\nThe total magnetic field will be in the negative z direction, as anticipated from \n\nFigure 4.

What force do they exert on each other?\n\nThere will be no force, since the currents cancel.\n\nThere will be an attractive force between the wires.\n\nThere will be a repulsive force between the wires.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe attractive force between two wires used to be the basis for defining the Ampère, the S.I. (base) unit for electric current. Before 2019, the Ampère was defined to be “that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2\\times 10^{-17} {\\rm N} per metre of length”. Recently, the definition was updated to be based on defining the Coulomb in such a way that the elementary charge has a numerical value of e=1.602176634\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm C}, and the Ampère corresponds to one Coulomb per second.\n\nThe force between two wires is a good system to understand how any physical quantity cannot depend on our choice of the right-hand to define cross-products. As mentioned in the previous chapter, any physical quantity, such as the direction of the force exerted on a wire, will always depend on two successive uses of the right hand. In this system, we first used the right-hand rule for axial vectors to determine the direction of the magnetic field from one of the wires. We then used the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the cross-product to determine the direction of the force on the other wire. You can verify that you get the same answer if you, instead, use your left-hand to define the direction of the magnetic field (which will be in the opposite direction), and then again for the cross-product. This also highlights that the magnetic field (and the electric field) is just a mathematical tool that we use to, ultimately, describe the motion of charges or compass needles.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nFor this problem, we can determine whether the force is attractive or repulsive by finding the directions of  the forces on wire 1 (\\vec{F_1}) and wire 2 (\\vec{F_2}). \n\nFigure 9 shows how to find the directions of \\vec{F_1} and \\vec{F_2} step by step using the right hand rules. The process is as follows:\n\nUse the axial right hand rule to find the magnetic field at wire 2 due to the current in wire 1 (\\vec{B_1}).\n\nUse the right hand rule to find the direction of the force on wire 2 due to its current and the magnetic field \\vec{B_1}.\n\nUse the axial right hand rule to find the magnetic field at wire 1 due to the current in wire 2 (\\vec{B_2}).\n\nUse the right hand rule to find the direction of the force on wire 1 due to its current and the magnetic field \\vec{B_2}.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:(a) Axial right hand rule to find \\vec{B_1}.

Ampère’s Law states:\\boxed{\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l =\\mu_0 I^{enc}}\n\nwhere the integral on the left is a “path integral”, similar to how we calculate the work done by a force over a particular path. The circle sign on the integral means that this is an integral over a “closed” path; a path where the starting and ending points are the same. I^{enc} is the net current that crosses the surface that is defined by the closed path, often called the “current enclosed” by the path. This is different from Gauss’ Law, where the integral is over a closed surface (not a closed path, as it is here). In the context of Gauss’ Law, we refer to “calculating the flux of the electric field through a closed surface”; in the context of Ampère’s Law, we refer to “calculating the circulation of the magnetic field along a closed path”.\n\nWe apply Ampère’s Law in much the same way as we apply Gauss’ Law:\n\nMake a good diagram, identify symmetries.\n\nChoose a closed path over which to calculate the circulation of the magnetic field (see below for how to choose the path). The path is often called an “Amperian loop” (think “Gaussian surface”).\n\nEvaluate the circulation integral.\n\nDetermine how much current is “enclosed” by the Amperian loop.\n\nApply Ampère’s Law.\n\nSimilarly to Gauss’ Law, we need to choose the path (instead of the surface) over which we will evaluate the integral.

The magnetic field from the wire must look the same regardless of the angle from which we view the wire (“azimuthal symmetry”). Thus, the magnetic field must either form concentric circles around the wire (which we know is the case from the Biot-Savart Law) or it must be in the radial direction (pointing towards or away from the wire). These two possibilities are illustrated in \n\nFigure 10, and we will pretend, for now, that we do not know which is correct.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:By symmetry, the magnetic field from a current-carrying infinite wire (illustrated with current coming out of the page), must either form concentric circles (left panel), or be in the radial direction (right panel). We know that the former (circles, left panel) is the correct choice. The dotted lines show “Ampèrian loops” that one can use to calculate the integral in Ampère’s Law.\n\nIn order to apply Ampère’s Law, we choose an Amperian loop (instead of a “Gaussian surface”). In the case of an infinite current-carrying wire, a circle that is concentric with the wire will meet the properties above, regardless of the two possible configurations of the magnetic field: with a circular Amperian loop, the angle between the magnetic field and the element d\\vec l is constant along the entire loop, and the magnitude of the magnetic field is constant along the loop. Our choice of loop is illustrated in \n\nFigure 11, where we have illustrated the magnetic field for the case where it forms concentric circles.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:An Amperian loop that is a circle of radius, h, will allow us to determine the magnetic field at a distance, h, from an infinitely-long current-carrying wire.\n\nThe circulation of the magnetic field along a circular path of radius, h, is given by:\\oint  \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l = \\oint B dl \\cos\\theta = \\cos\\theta \\oint B dl=B\\cos\\theta \\oint dl=B\\cos\\theta (2\\pi h)\n\nwhere \\cos\\theta is 1 if the field forms circles (correct) or 0 if the field is radial (incorrect). We can now evaluate the current that is enclosed by the Amperian loop. The current that is enclosed is given by the net current that traverses the surface defined by the Amperian loop (in this case, a circle of radius h). Since the loop encloses the entire wire, the enclosed current is simply I. Applying Ampère’s Law:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &=\\mu_0 I^{enc}\\\\\nB\\cos\\theta (2\\pi h) &= \\mu_0 I\n\nAt this point, it is clear that \\cos\\theta cannot be zero, since the right-hand side of the equation is not zero. We can thus conclude that the magnetic field must indeed make concentric circles, as we had previously determined. The magnitude of the magnetic field is given by:B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi h}\n\nas we found previously with the Biot-Savart Law. Again, in analogy with Gauss’ Law, one needs to apply some knowledge of symmetry and argue in which direction the magnetic field should point, in order to use Ampère’s Law effectively.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nAmpère’s law proves that the magnetic field at the centre of a current-carrying loop is zero because there is no enclosed current:\n\nTrue.\n\nFalse.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nLet’s compare Ampere’s law to Gauss’s law. Recall that Gauss’s law is given by:\\oint \\vec{E}\\cdot d\\vec{A}=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}.\n\nWe want to construct a Gaussian surface such that we can write this asEA=\\frac{Q^{enc}}{\\epsilon_0},\n\nwhere A is the surface area that is perpendicular to the field lines and E is the (constant) magnitude of the electric field over the surface. The flux is given by Q^{enc}/\\epsilon_0. To find the electric field at any point on the surface, we useE=\\frac{Q^{enc}/\\epsilon_0}{A}.\n\nIn other words, the electric field is the flux per unit area. Ampère’s law is very similar, except that instead of flux, we have the new concept of “circulation” and instead of a surface integral, we have a line integral. When we have a high degree of symmetry in Ampère’s law, we are often able to write:\\oint \\vec{B}\\cdot d\\vec{l}=\\mu_0 I^{enc}\\rightarrow Bl=\\mu_0 I^{enc}\n\nwhere l is the length of the Amperian loop that is parallel to the field, B is the magnitude of the magnetic field, and \\mu_0 I^{enc} gives us the circulation. To find the magnetic field, we useB=\\frac{\\mu_0 I^{enc}}{l},\n\nso the magnetic field is like the circulation per unit length.\n\nIn the left panel of \n\nFigure 12, I have shown two Amperian loops with different radii, for the example of the straight wire with a current coming out of the page. Ampère’s law tells us that the circulation will be the same along each path. However, because the inner loop is smaller, the circulation per unit length (the magnetic field) will be larger at each point. This is represented in the right panel, where the length of the vectors is proportional to the magnetic field strength.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:Left: 2 Amperian loops around a current carrying wire. Right: Magnetic field vectors around each loop.\n\nExample 21.1\n\nA long solid uniform cable of radius, R, carries current, I, with a current density that is uniform through the cross-section of the cable. Determine the strength of the magnetic field as a function of r, the distance from the centre of the cable, inside and outside of the cable.\n\nSolution\n\nIn this case, we need to determine the magnetic field both inside and outside of the cable. \n\nFigure 13 shows two circular Amperian loops that we can use to apply Ampère’s Law to determine the magnetic field inside and outside of the cable.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:Two circular Amperian loops to determine the magnitude of the magnetic field inside and outside of a current-carrying cable of radius, R (with uniform current coming out of the page).\n\nBy symmetry, and following the discussion in this chapter, we know that the magnetic field must form concentric circles, both inside and outside of the cable. Outside the cable, we proceed in the same fashion as above, choosing an Amperian loop of radius, r>R, such that the circulation is given by:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l= B 2\\pi r\n\nThe entire cable is enclosed by the loop, so that the enclosed current is, I. Thus, Ampère’s Law gives:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &=\\mu_0 I^{enc}\\\\\nB (2\\pi r) &= \\mu_0 I\\\\\n\\therefore B &= \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}\\quad(r\\geq R)\n\nInside of the cable, the circulation integral around a circular path of radius, r<R, is the same:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l= B 2\\pi r\n\nHowever, in this case, the smaller Amperian loop does not enclose all of the current flowing through the cable. We are told that the current density, j, is uniform in the cable. We can thus determine the current per unit area (i.e. the current density) that flows through the whole cable, and use that to determine how much current flows through the surface with area \\pi r^2 that is defined by the Amperian loop:j &= \\frac{I}{A}=\\frac{I}{\\pi R^2}\\\\\n\\therefore I^{enc} &= j(\\pi r^2) = \\frac{I}{\\pi R^2}(\\pi r^2)=I\\frac{r^2}{R^2}\n\nFinally, we can apply Ampère’s Law to determine the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the cable:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &=\\mu_0 I^{enc}\\\\\nB (2\\pi r) &= \\mu_0 I\\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\\\\n\\therefore B &= \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi R^2}r\n\nand we find that the magnetic field is zero at the centre of the cable (r=0), and increases linearly up to the edge of the cable (r=R).\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we used Ampère’s Law to model the strength of the magnetic field inside and outside of a current-carrying cable. In order to apply Ampère’s Law inside the cable, we took into account that only a fraction of the current is enclosed by the Amperian loop. This problem is analogous to applying Gauss’ Law to determine the electric field inside and outside of a uniformly charged sphere.","type":"content","url":"/magneticsource#amp-res-law","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 21 - Sources of magnetic field","lvl3":"Interpretation of Ampère’s Law and vector calculus","lvl2":"Ampère’s Law"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/magneticsource#sec-magneticsource-interpretation","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 21 - Sources of magnetic field","lvl3":"Interpretation of Ampère’s Law and vector calculus","lvl2":"Ampère’s Law"},"content":"In this section, we discuss Ampère’s Law in the context of vector calculus and provide a different perspective, mostly for informational purposes. The integral that appears in Ampère’s Law is called the “circulation” of the vector field, \\vec B:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nThe circulation, as its name implies, is a measure of “how much rotation there is in the field”. To visualize this, imagine that the vector field is a velocity field for points in a fluid. Regions of the fluid where there are little whirlpools (so called “eddies”), correspond to regions of the field with non-zero circulation (the sign of the integral tells us the direction of rotation, using the right-hand rule for axial vectors). Examples of field with and without circulation are shown in \n\nFigure 14. You will recognize that static electric charges create electric fields with no circulation (right panel), whereas static currents create magnetic fields with circulation.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:Examples of field with (left panel) and without (right panel) circulation, as evaluated along the closed loop shown with the dashed line.\n\nAmpère’s Law is thus a statement that an electric current will result in a field with a magnitude proportional to the current, that has some degree of rotation to it. The direction of rotation of that field corresponds to the right-hand rule for axial vectors as applied to the current (your thumb points in the direction of the current so that your fingers curl in the direction of the rotation of the associated field).\n\nCirculation, as defined by the integral over a closed loop, is not a local property of the field, since it depends on what the field is doing as a whole over the path of the loop. Just as one can obtain a “local” version of  Gauss’ Law, one can also obtain a local version of Ampère’s Law using techniques from advanced vector calculus (that are beyond the scope of this textbook).\n\nStokes’ theorem allows one to convert the circulation integral (a path integral on a closed loop) into a integral over the (open) surface that is defined by the loop:\\oint_C \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l = \\int_S (\\nabla \\times \\vec B) \\cdot d\\vec A\n\nwhere the subscript C indicates that the integral is over a one-dimensional path, whereas the subscript S indicates that the integral is over a two-dimensional surface. The term, \\nabla \\times \\vec B, is called the “curl” of the magnetic field and is a local measure of the amount of rotation in the field. Applying Stokes’ theorem to Ampère’s Law yield:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &= \\mu_0 I^{enc}\\\\\n\\int_S (\\nabla \\times \\vec B) \\cdot d\\vec A &= \\mu_0 I^{enc}\\\\\n\nNote that we can also write the current, I^{enc}, that is enclosed by the loop as the integral of the current density, \\vec j, over the surface defined by the loop:I^{enc}=\\int _S \\vec j \\cdot d\\vec A\n\nThus, we can write Ampère’s Law with integrals over the same surface on either side of the equation, implying that the integrands must be the same:\\int_S (\\nabla \\times \\vec B) \\cdot d\\vec A = \\mu_0 \\int _S \\vec j \\cdot d\\vec A\\\\\\therefore\\;\\;\\boxed{ \\nabla \\times \\vec B = \\mu_0 \\vec j}\n\nThis last equation now relates a local property (current density) to the magnetic field at that point, and is the usual form in which Ampère’s Law is presented (the so-called “differential form”, rather than the “integral form”).\n\nThe curl of the magnetic field, \\nabla \\times \\vec B, is a vector that is given by the following:\\nabla \\times \\vec B = \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat x + \\left(\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat y+\\left(\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat z\n\nand the name “curl” is chosen because this is a measure of the amount of rotation (curl) in the field. In differential form, Ampère’s Law can read as: “a current density will create a (magnetic) field that has non-zero curl”.\n\nSince Ampère’s Law in differential form is a vector equation (both sides are vectors), it really corresponds to three equations in Cartesian coordinates, one per component. For example, the x component of the equation is a “partial differential equation” for the y and z components of the magnetic field:\\left(\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z}\\right) &=\\mu_0j_x\n\nthat is in general difficult to solve without a computer (and all three equations are required, as these are “coupled”, since a given component of the magnetic field appears in two of three equations).","type":"content","url":"/magneticsource#sec-magneticsource-interpretation","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 21 - Sources of magnetic field","lvl2":"Solenoids and toroids"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/magneticsource#solenoids-and-toroids","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 21 - Sources of magnetic field","lvl2":"Solenoids and toroids"},"content":"In order to create strong magnetic fields, the most practical method is to combine many loops of current together into a “solenoid” (a coil). Electromagnets function on this principle and are ubiquitous in our lives. \n\nFigure 15 shows the magnetic field from a single loop of current.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:The magnetic field from a single loop of current.\n\nWhen several loops of current are brought close together, as in \n\nFigure 16, the magnetic field inside the solenoid becomes uniform, and the magnetic field just outside the solenoid approaches zero.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:As multiple loops of current are brought together to form a solenoid, the magnetic field inside the solenoid becomes uniform and the field outside the solenoid approaches zero.\n\nWe can use Ampère’s Law to determine the strength of the magnetic field inside of a solenoid, under the assumption that the magnetic field is uniform in the volume of the solenoid and zero just outside. Consider a solenoid with current, I, going through it, that contains n loops per unit length. In order to determine the magnetic field, B, inside of the solenoid, consider the rectangular Amperian loop, abcd, of length, l, illustrated in \n\nFigure 17.\n\n\n\nFigure 17:We use Ampère’s Law with a rectangular loop to evaluate the strength of the magnetic field inside a solenoid.\n\nIn order to evaluate the circulation of the magnetic field around the loop, abcd, we divide the loop up into segments, and evaluate the path integral (\\int \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l) over each segment, then add those together to obtain the integral over the closed path:\\oint_{abcd} \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l = \\int_a^b \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l + \\int_b^c \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l + \\int_c^d \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l + \\int_d^a \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l\n\nOver each segment, the vector d\\vec l will be parallel to that segment. Only the last term is non-zero. The integrals over the segments ab and cd are zero because the magnetic field is perpendicular to d\\vec l over those segments (so the scalar product is zero). The integral over the segment bc is zero because the magnetic field is zero just outside the solenoid. The integral over the last segment, where d\\vec l and \\vec B are parallel, is simply given by:\\oint_{abcd} \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &= \\int_d^a \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l\\\\\n&= B \\int_d^a dl\\\\\n&= Bl\n\nsince the length of the segment is l, and the magnetic field is constant in magnitude.\n\nIn order to apply Ampère’s Law, we must determine the current that is enclosed by our Amperian loop. Since the rectangular loop has a length, l, it will enclose N=nl loops of current, I, since there are n loops per unit length. Thus the enclosed current is I^{enc}=nlI. Applying Ampère’s Law, we find the magnetic field inside a solenoid:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &=\\mu_0 I^{enc}\\\\\nBl &= \\mu_0 nIl\\\\\\therefore\\;\\; \\boxed{B = \\mu_0 nI}\\quad \\text{(Field inside a solenoid)}\n\nwhich does not depend on our (arbitrary) choice of making an Amperian loop with an arbitrary length of l. In practice, when solenoids are used as electromagnets, they are typically filled with a ferromagnetic material, which will magnetise when there is a current, resulting in a stronger magnetic field. This is usually done by winding a wire around an iron rod.\n\nNote that if we extend the Amperian loop so that the bottom segment is also outside the solenoid, as in \n\nFigure 18, it is easy to show that the magnetic field immediately outside of the solenoid must be zero. Indeed, in this case, there are an equal number of currents coming out of the page as there are going into the page, so that the net current that is enclosed by the Amperian loop (the net current that crosses the plane of the loop) is identically zero, so that the circulation must be zero, implying that the magnetic field is zero just outside the solenoid.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:By extending the Amperian loop to both sides of the solenoid, we conclude that the magnetic field just outside the solenoid must be zero, because the net current enclosed is zero.\n\nA toroid can be thought of as a solenoid that has been bent into the shape of a circle (or rather, a torus), as illustrated in \n\nFigure 19. Inside the toroid, the magnetic field forms concentric circles (not shown).\n\n\n\nFigure 19:An Amperian loop of radius r to determine the magnetic field inside of a toroid. Note that the magnetic field everywhere outside the toroid must be zero (think of the current enclosed by Amperian loops).\n\nAgain, we can use Ampère’s Law to determine the strength of the magnetic field inside the toroid. Consider the circular Amperian loop of radius r that is illustrated in \n\nFigure 19. Since the magnetic field is parallel to the Amperian loop everywhere along the loop, and the magnetic field does not change magnitude (by symmetry), the circulation is given by:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &= B (2\\pi r)\n\nIf the toroid contains N loops of current, then the enclosed current is given by I^{enc}=NI, since the Amperian loop include N times the current I coming out of the page. Ampère’s Law thus gives the magnitude of the magnetic field as:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &=\\mu_0 I^{enc}\\\\\nB (2\\pi r) &= \\mu_0 NI\\\\\n\\therefore B&=\\frac{\\mu_0 NI}{2\\pi r}\n\nwhich decreases in magnitude with increasing radius, as long as we are inside the toroid. It is easy to show, by using Amperian loops that are either smaller or bigger than the toroid, that the magnetic field everywhere outside of the toroid is exactly zero (as those Amperian loops will enclose no net current). In a toroid, the magnetic field lines form closed circles. For a solenoid, there must exist a magnetic field somewhere outside the solenoid, in order for the field lines inside the solenoid to close. We can usually ignore these if the solenoid is long, as the field outside will be very weak, and very close to zero very close the solenoid (as we showed with Ampère’s Law above).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIn \n\nFigure 19, the magnetic field makes concentric circles.

In this case, if your fingers curl in the direction of the current loop, your thumb points in the same direction as the magnetic field at the centre of the loop.\n\nTwo parallel wires carrying currents, I_1 and I_2, separated by a distance, h, will exert equal and opposite forces on each other with a magnitude:F = \\frac{\\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\\pi h}\n\nThe force is attractive if the two currents flow in the same direction and repulsive otherwise.\n\nAmpère’s Law is the magnetism analogue to Gauss’ Law. Just like Gauss’ Law, it requires a high degree of symmetry to be applied analytically, although it is always valid. Ampère’s Law relates the circulation of the magnetic field around a closed path to the current enclosed by that path:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l =\\mu_0 I^{enc}\n\nIn order to apply Ampère’s Law, we must first choose an Amperian loop over which to compute the closed path integral (instead of choosing a Gaussian surface to calculate the flux of the electric field on a closed surface). The circulation integral will be straightforward to evaluate if:\n\nThe angle between \\vec B and d\\vec l is constant along the path, so that:\\oint  \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l &= \\oint B dl \\cos\\theta\\\\\n&= \\cos\\theta \\oint B dl\n\nwhere θ is the angle between \\vec B and d\\vec l.\n\nThe magnitude of \\vec B is constant along the path, so that:\\cos\\theta \\oint B dl = B\\cos\\theta \\oint dl\n\nThe current enclosed, I^{enc}, corresponds to the net current that crosses the surface that is defined by the Amperian loop (a closed path always defines a surface).\n\nAmpère’s Law is straightforward to use in situations with a high degree of symmetry, such as infinitely long wires carrying current.\n\nSolenoids are formed by combining many loops of current together, in order to form a strong and uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field inside of a solenoid has a magnitude of:B=\\mu_0nI\n\nwhere, I, is the current in the solenoid, and n, is the number of loops per unit length in the solenoid.  The magnetic field just outside of a solenoid is zero, and generally, the magnetic field is negligible outside of a solenoid.\n\nA toroid is formed by bending a solenoid into a circle to form a torus.

In this chapter, we describe how an electric current can be produced (or rather, “induced”) by a magnetic field. The most important aspect of electromagnetic induction is that it always involves quantities that change with time. In past chapters, we have only dealt with static electric and magnetic fields, static charges (for electric fields), and static currents (for magnetic fields).\n\nFaraday’s law connects the flux of a time-varying magnetic field to an induced voltage (rather than a current). For historical reasons, the induced voltage is also called an induced “electromotive force” (emf), even if it is a voltage and not a force. Faraday’s law is as follows:\\boxed{\\Delta V = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}}\n\nwhere \\Delta V is the induced voltage, and  \\Phi_B is the flux of the magnetic field through an open surface, defined in the same way as the flux of the electric field (\n\nSection 16.2):\\Phi_B = \\int_S \\vec B\\cdot d\\vec A\n\nIf the magnetic field has a constant magnitude over the surface, S, and always makes the same angle with the surface, then the flux can be written as:\\Phi_B =  \\vec B\\cdot\\vec A\n\nwhere the magnitude of the vector \\vec A is equal to the area of the surface, and the vector \\vec A is normal to the surface.\n\nThe surface, S, is defined by a closed path. The induced voltage can be thought of as an ideal battery placed in the closed path that defines the surface (right-hand panel of \n\nFigure 1). The minus sign in Faraday’s Law indicates the direction of the current associated with the induced voltage. It is important to note that an induced voltage only exists if the flux of the magnetic field changes (since the induced voltage is given by the time-derivative of the flux). Remember, induction is all about time-varying fields! This is better illustrated with an example.\n\nConsider a loop of wire that is immersed in a uniform magnetic field, \\vec B, that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 1. As time goes by, the magnetic field increases in strength, as shown in going from the left panel to the right panel. The flux of the magnetic field through the loop increases in magnitude, and a voltage is thus induced across the wire (illustrated by the ideal battery on the loop in the right panel), leading to an induced current, I.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:As the magnetic field increases, so does the flux through the loop that is shown. The changing flux results in an induced voltage, which produces an induced current that has a magnetic moment, \\vec \\mu_I. The induced current produces a magnetic field in a direction to oppose the changing flux.\n\nWhen calculating the flux of the magnetic field, we have to choose the surface element vector, d\\vec A, to be perpendicular to the surface over which we calculate the flux. There are two choices (upwards or downwards, referring to \n\nFigure 1); we chose to define d\\vec A to point upwards. Thus, the magnetic flux is positive in both panels, and increases with time. The derivative, d\\vec B/dt, is positive and the right-hand side of Faraday’s equation is negative because of the negative sign in front. Had we chosen to define d\\vec A to point downwards, the right-hand side of Faraday’s law would be negative.\n\nWe can describe the direction of the induced current, I, in terms of its magnetic dipole moment (\n\nSection 20.5.1), \\vec\\mu_I, also shown in \n\nFigure 1. The overall sign on the right-hand side of Faraday’s law is determined by our (arbitrary) choice of the direction d\\vec A. With this choice, we found that the right-hand side of Faraday’s law is negative:\\Delta V = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}=\\text{a negative number}\n\nThe overall sign of \\Delta V indicates whether the magnetic moment of the induced current is parallel (\\Delta V positive) or anti-parallel (\\Delta V negative) to d\\vec A. This allows us to determine the direction of the induced current, and thus the direction of the ideal battery that represents the induced voltage. In general, when possible, it is common to choose the direction of d\\vec A to be parallel to the magnetic field vector, so that the flux is positive (although this does not guarantee that its derivative is positive).","type":"content","url":"/induction#faradays-law","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"Lenz’s law","lvl2":"Faraday’s Law"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/induction#lenzs-law","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"Lenz’s law","lvl2":"Faraday’s Law"},"content":"The minus sign in Faraday’s law is sometimes called “Lenz’s law”, and ultimately comes from the conservation of energy. In \n\nFigure 1 above, we found that as the magnetic flux increases through the loop, a current is induced. That induced current will also produce a magnetic field (in the direction of its magnetic dipole moment vector, \\vec \\mu_I).\n\nLenz’s law states that the “induced current will always be such that the magnetic field that it produces counteracts the changing magnetic field that induced the current”. In \n\nFigure 1, the magnetic field points in the upwards direction, and increases in magnitude with time. The induced current produces a magnetic field that points downwards to counteract the changing magnetic field, and preserve a constant flux through the loop. If this were not the case, the induced current would be in the opposite direction, contributing to the increasing magnetic flux through the loop, inducing more current, producing more flux, inducing more current, etc. Clearly, this would lead to an infinite current and solve the world’s energy crisis. Unfortunately, conservation of energy (expressed here as Lenz’s law) prevents this from happening.\n\nYou can use Lenz’s law to determine the direction of induced currents. In general:\n\nIf the magnitude of the magnetic flux is increasing in the loop, then the induced current produces a magnetic field that is in the opposite direction from the original magnetic field.\n\nIf the magnitude of the magnetic flux is decreasing in the loop, then the induced current produces a magnetic field that is in the same direction as the original magnetic field.\n\nThe negative sign in Faraday’s law is not arbitrary (as we saw above, it gives the correct direction for the magnetic moment of the induced current, given our arbitrary choice of direction for d\\vec A). In practice, one can often use Lenz’s law to determine the direction of the induced current (so that it counteracts the changing flux), and Faraday’s law to determine the magnitude of the induced voltage.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nA loop of wire is immersed in a constant and uniform magnetic field out of the page, perpendicular to the plane of the loop, as shown in \n\nFigure 2.

A coil, made of N circular loops of radius, r, lies in the x-y plane. If the coil has a total resistance, R, what is the magnitude and direction of the current induced in the coil?\n\nSolution\n\nThe coil is made of N loops of wire. Each loop of wire can be treated independently, and each will have its own induced voltage across it. Since each loop is the same, they will all have the same induced voltage, and the total voltage induced across the coil, \\Delta V, will be given by:\\Delta V = -N \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\nwhere \\Phi_B is the flux through any one of the loops. That is, each loop is similar to an ideal battery, and the coil is similar to placing all of these batteries in series, so that the voltages from each battery sum together.\n\nThe coil lies the x-y plane, perpendicular to the increasing magnetic field, similar to the situation depicted in \n\nFigure 1. Since the magnetic field is uniform over the surface of the coil, we do not need an integral to determine the flux. We define the area vector, \\vec A, to be in the positive z direction (parallel to the magnetic field):\\vec A = A \\hat z = \\pi r^2 \\hat z\n\nThe flux through one circular loop of radius, r, is given by:\\Phi_B (t) &= \\vec B \\cdot \\vec A = ( B_0(1+at)\\hat z) \\cdot (\\pi r^2 \\hat z) =B_0(1+at) (\\pi r^2)\n\nWe can apply Faraday’s law to determine the induced voltage:\\Delta V &= -N \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = -N \\frac{d}{dt} B_0(1+at) (\\pi r^2)\\\\\n&=-NB_0a\\pi r^2\n\nSince the induced voltage is negative, the magnetic moment of the induced current points in the negative z direction (opposite to our choice of direction for \\vec A). This is consistent with Lenz’s law, since the magnetic field increases in the positive z direction, the induced current will produce a magnetic field in the negative z direction to counteract the changing flux. The magnitude of the induced current is given by Ohm’s Law:I = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R}=\\frac{NB_0a\\pi r^2}{R}\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we determined the induced voltage and current in a coil made of N identical loops. We argued that one can sum the induced voltages from the N loops, as these can be thought of as ideal batteries in series. We found that the direction of the induced current as obtained from Faraday’s law was consistent with the expectation from Lenz’s law.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nHere are some steps you can follow to find the direction of the current using Lenz’s law.\n\nDraw a diagram showing the loop/coil and the magnetic field lines.\n\nI like to indicate whether the flux is increasing or decreasing by drawing a “flux arrow” (a term that I made up, so please don’t use it around physicists because they won’t know what you’re talking about). If the flux is increasing, this will point in the same direction as the field lines. If it is decreasing, the flux arrow will point opposite to the field lines.\n\nAssume that the induced current is in the clockwise direction and use the axial right hand rule to determine the direction of the induced magnetic field.\n\nRepeat Step 2 assuming the counter-clockwise direction.\n\nDecide which direction for the induced current will give you the desired field. We want the induced field to point opposite to the flux arrow.\n\nThis is how you would apply this method to \n\nExample 22.1 (note that I am using the example of a loop instead of a coil but the idea is the same):\n\nWe draw the diagram, as in \n\nFigure 4a.\n\nTo show that the flux is increasing, I have drawn a “flux arrow” (again, made up) in the direction of the field lines (the +z direction).\n\nIf the current is clockwise, the induced field points in the -z direction inside the loop (\n\nFigure 4b).\n\nIf the current is counter-clockwise, the induced field points in the +z direction inside the loop (\n\nFigure 4c).\n\nSince the flux is increasing, we want an induced current that will decrease the flux. We choose the clockwise current because the induced field points opposite to the flux arrow.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:(a) An increasing magnetic field through a loop. (b) A clockwise current induces a magnetic field in the -z direction. (c) A counter-clockwise current induces a magnetic field in the +z direction.","type":"content","url":"/induction#lenzs-law","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Induction in a moving conductor"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/induction#induction-in-a-moving-conductor","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Induction in a moving conductor"},"content":"If we define a loop of wire, there are two ways in which the magnetic flux through that loop can change:\n\nThe magnetic field can change magnitude or direction, as we saw in \n\nExample 22.1.\n\nThe loop can change size or orientation relative to the magnetic field.\n\nIn this section, we examine the latter case, sometimes called “motional emf”, as the induced voltage is the result of motion from the loop in which the voltage is induced.","type":"content","url":"/induction#induction-in-a-moving-conductor","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"Motion of a bar on two parallel rails","lvl2":"Induction in a moving conductor"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/induction#motion-of-a-bar-on-two-parallel-rails","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"Motion of a bar on two parallel rails","lvl2":"Induction in a moving conductor"},"content":"Consider a U-shaped rail in a uniform magnetic field on top of which a bar can slide with no friction, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 5.

At some time t, the flux through the loop is given by:\\Phi_B (t) &=  \\vec B \\cdot \\vec A =BA=BLvt\n\nwhere we chose \\vec A to be parallel to the magnetic field vector.\n\nSince we already used Lenz’s law to argue that the current must be in the clockwise direction, we can use Faraday’s law to determine the magnitude of the induced voltage and ignore the negative sign:\\Delta V = \\frac{d \\Phi_B}{dt}=\\frac{d}{dt}BLvt = BLv\n\nSuppose that the rails are superconducting (have no resistance), and that the bar has a resistance, R. The current through the loop is then given by Ohm’s Law:I=\\frac{\\Delta V}{R}=\\frac{BLv}{R}\n\nAs the current moves through the bar, it will heat up the bar by dissipating energy at a rate of:P=I^2 R = \\frac{B^2L^2v^2}{R}\n\nThus, the bar cannot possibly move at a constant speed on its own, or energy would be produced out of nothing. There must be a force exerted on the bar to keep it moving at constant speed.\n\nRecall that a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field will experience a force from the magnetic field. In this case, the bar of length L carries a current, I, in a magnetic field, \\vec B (perpendicular to the current), so that the force exerted on the bar is given by:\\vec F_B = I \\vec L \\times \\vec B\n\nand points to the left (right-hand rule). The magnitude of the force is given by:F_B = ILB = \\frac{B^2L^2v}{R}\n\nThus, in order for the bar to move at constant velocity towards the right, a force with the same magnitude must be exerted towards the right. In other words, work must be done to pull the bar to the right, by exerting a force with the magnitude, F_B. The rate at which that work must be done is given by:P &= \\frac{d}{dt}W\\\\\n&=\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec F \\cdot dx\\\\\n&=\\vec F\\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt}\\\\\n&=\\vec F\\cdot \\vec v = Fv\\\\\n&=\\frac{B^2L^2v^2}{R}\n\nwhere we assumed that the bar moves in the positive x direction. This is exactly the rate at which electric energy is dissipated in the bar! In other words, by doing mechanical work on the bar, we can create an induced current that will dissipate that energy at the same rate at which we do work. We can convert mechanical work into electrical energy!\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nI’ll quickly sum up what is happening in this example:\n\nWe pull the bar to the right.\n\nThe flux in the loop increases, which produces a current in the clockwise direction according to Lenz’s law. We can calculate the potential difference to produce this current using Faraday’s law.\n\nThe downwards current in the bar produces a force to the left according to the Lorentz force, F=I\\vec{l}\\times \\vec{B}. To move the bar at a constant velocity, the force we apply to pull the bar should be equal to the Lorentz force.\n\nAssuming the bar has a resistance, power is dissipated in the resistor. Power is dissipated at the same rate as the work done by us to pull the bar.\n\nFinally, also note that this situation is closely related to the Hall effect, which is simply a different way to think about this problem. Consider the electrons that are in the bar, as the bar moves at constant speed to the right through the magnetic field (ignore the existence of the U-shaped rail). The electrons will experience a magnetic force that is upwards (consistent with the direction of the induced current discussed above). Eventually, electrons accumulate at the top of the bar, and start preventing more electrons from accumulating there, by producing an electric field, \\vec E, in the bar. The equilibrium condition is that the magnetic force and the electric force have the same magnitude (and opposite directions):qvB &= qE\\\\\nE &= vB\n\nThe (Hall) potential difference, across the bar of length, L, with an electric field, E, is given by:\\Delta V_{Hall} = EL = vBL\n\nwhere we assumed that the electric field is uniform in the bar. This potential difference is identical to the one that we calculated from Faraday’s law. Viewing this example as a different manifestation of the Hall effect provides some insight into what is actually happening at the microscopic level when a current is induced.","type":"content","url":"/induction#motion-of-a-bar-on-two-parallel-rails","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"The generator","lvl2":"Induction in a moving conductor"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/induction#the-generator","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"The generator","lvl2":"Induction in a moving conductor"},"content":"An electrical generator is used to create an alternating induced voltage/current by rotating a coil inside of a constant and uniform magnetic field. In this case, the current is induced because the angle between the magnetic field and the surface element vector d\\vec A changes with time.\n\nConsider a single loop of wire with area A that can rotate in a uniform and constant magnetic field, \\vec B, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:A loop of wire rotates in a constant and uniform magnetic field. At time t=0 (left panel), the loop lies in the yz plane. The loop rotates about the y axis, with a constant angular velocity, \\vec \\omega. At some time t later, the loop has rotated through an angle \\theta = \\omega t (right panel, as seen from above, looking down on the xz plane).\n\nReferring to the coordinate system that is illustrated in \n\nFigure 6, the loop has a constant angular velocity, \\vec\\omega, in the positive y direction and rotates about the y axis (with the origin at the centre of the coil). At time t=0 (left panel), the loop lies in the yz plane, and we choose the vector \\vec A (used to calculate the flux) to be in the positive x direction at time t=0. As the coil rotates, so will the vector \\vec A, which is easier to visualize than the coil. At some time t, the vector \\vec A will make an angle \\theta=\\omega t with the x axis (right panel). The magnetic field is constant and in the positive x direction, \\vec B = B\\hat x. That is, the angle between the vector \\vec A and the magnetic field, \\vec B, will be given by \\theta = \\omega t.\n\nAt some time, t, the vector \\vec A is given by:\\vec A(t) = A(\\cos\\theta \\hat x -\\sin\\theta \\hat z) = A(\\cos(\\omega t) \\hat x -\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat z)\n\nWe can calculate the flux of the magnetic field through the loop at some time t:\\Phi_B(t) =  \\vec B \\cdot \\vec A = (B\\hat x) \\cdot (A\\cos(\\omega t) \\hat x -A\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat z)=AB\\cos(\\omega t)\n\nwhere we did not use the integral for the flux, since the magnetic field is constant over the area of the loop. The induced voltage is given by Faraday’s law:\\Delta V = - \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}  =  - \\frac{d}{dt}AB\\cos(\\omega t) =  AB\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)\n\nIf the generator includes N loops in a coil, then the induced voltage is given by:\\Delta V = NAB\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)\n\nAs you can see, the voltage oscillates with time, between \\pm NAB\\omega, corresponding to alternating voltage. Furthermore, since the sign of \\Delta V changes with time (due to the sine function), the relative orientation between \\vec A and the magnetic dipole moment of the induced current, also changes with time, indicating that the induced current in the coil changes direction every half-turn (alternating current).\n\nThe generators that produce the alternating voltages that we find in our outlets work on the same principle. For example, in a hydro-electric dam, the water pressure from the height of the dam is used to force water through a turbine (essentially a propeller) that rotates a set of coils inside of a strong permanent magnet. Various controls allow the rotational frequency of the turbine to be adjusted in order to produce alternating current of the desired frequency (50 {\\rm Hz} in most of the world, 60 {\\rm Hz} in North America and a few other countries).\n\nSince the generator produces current that can dissipate electrical energy, one has to do work in order to keep the coil in the generator rotating. As the coil rotates, a current is induced in the coil. A current in a circular loop that is immersed in a magnetic field will experience a torque, \\vec \\tau, given by:\\vec \\tau = \\vec \\mu \\times \\vec B\n\nwhere \\vec \\mu is the magnetic dipole moment of the coil with induced current, I. If the current from the coil dissipates its energy in a system with resistance, R, then the current in the coil is given by Ohm’s Law:I = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R}=\\frac{NAB\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)}{R}\n\nThe magnetic moment, \\vec \\mu, for the current in the coil is given by:\\vec \\mu &= I\\vec A = \\frac{NAB\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)}{R} (A(\\cos(\\omega t) \\hat x -\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat z))\\\\\n&=\\frac{NA^2B\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)}{R} (\\cos(\\omega t) \\hat x -\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat z)\n\nThe torque exerted by the magnetic field on the coil with the induced current is thus given by:\\vec \\tau &= \\vec \\mu \\times \\vec B = \\left(\\frac{NA^2B\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)}{R} (\\cos(\\omega t) \\hat x -\\sin(\\omega t)\\hat z)\\right) \\times (B\\hat x)\\\\\n&=\\frac{NA^2B^2\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)}{R}(\\cos\\omega(t)(\\hat x \\times \\hat x)-\\sin(\\omega t)(\\hat z \\times \\hat x))\\\\\n&=-\\frac{NA^2B^2\\omega\\sin^2(\\omega t)}{R}\\hat y\n\nNote that the torque exerted on the loop is always in the negative y direction, as every term in the torque is either strictly positive (N,R) or squared (\\sin^2(\\omega t)). The torque exerted by the magnetic field on the coil is thus always in the opposite direction of rotation (recall that the coil has an angular velocity in the positive y direction). This is sometimes called “counter torque”. If we want the coil to maintain a constant angular velocity, then we must exert a torque in the positive y direction to counter the torque from the magnetic field. Note that the torque that we must exert to keep the coil rotating with constant angular velocity is not constant in time (but always in the same direction).\n\nYou can easily verify that the work that you must do by exerting the torque is the same as the electrical power dissipated by the current in the resistor, R. The generator is thus a device to convert mechanical work into electrical energy (with AC current, in particular).","type":"content","url":"/induction#the-generator","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Back EMF in an electric motor"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/induction#back-emf-in-an-electric-motor","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Back EMF in an electric motor"},"content":"There are many similarities between electric motors and generators, and in fact, they can be thought of as the same device. In an electric motor, current is passed through a coil in a magnetic field, so that a torque is exerted on the coil, and it starts to rotate. In a generator, one exerts a torque to rotate the coil, thus inducing a current.\n\nConsider an electric motor. As we supply current to the motor, the coil starts to rotate. But, a rotating coil in a magnetic field results in an induced current. By Lenz’s law, the induced current in the coil of a motor has to be in the direction opposite to the current that we put in, since otherwise, the motor would start to spin infinitely fast. We call this effect “back emf”, as the motor effectively acts like a battery that opposes current, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A simple circuit illustrating how a motor, with resistance, R_{motor}, will generate a “back emf”, equivalent to a battery that produces a voltage in the direction to oppose the current from the actual battery that is powering the motor, \\Delta V.\n\nIf you connect an electric motor to a voltage source, initially, the motor is at rest, so there will be no back emf and the current through the circuit will be very large (motors have a small resistance, so that the electrical energy is converted into work rather than heating up the motor). As the motor starts to spin faster, the back emf from the motor grows, reducing the current in the circuit. If there is no load on the motor (i.e. the motor can rotate freely with no friction), then the rotational speed of the motor will increase until the back emf exactly matches the voltage supplied to the motor. The motor will then rotate at constant speed, with (almost) no current in the circuit (if the motor slows down, the emf will decrease, and the current will increase to speed up the motor). If there is a load on the motor (because it’s making something turn), then the motor will rotate at a speed that is lower than that which would result in zero current, since some of that current is now used by the motor to exert a torque.\n\nYou may notice that the lights in your house dim briefly as your refrigerator turns on. This is because your refrigerator uses an electric motor that initially draws a large current when it turns on, large enough to produce a voltage drop in the circuit of your house to observe a dimming of your lights. You may also notice that if you plug the inlet or outlet of a hair dryer, the hair dryer turns off quickly. In this case, by blocking the flow of air, you prevent the motor in the hair dryer from rotating; this results in a large current through its coil, since there is no back emf. Most hair dryers have a circuit breaker that will detect this large current and open the circuit to prevent the coil in the motor from over heating and melting. In general, one should not prevent an electric motor from rotating, as this will result in a large current through the motor that could melt its internal components.","type":"content","url":"/induction#back-emf-in-an-electric-motor","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"The induced electric field and eddy currents"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/induction#the-induced-electric-field-and-eddy-currents","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"The induced electric field and eddy currents"},"content":"So far, we have described electromagnetic induction in terms of the voltage that is induced by a changing magnetic field. This voltage is related to an electric field, which we discuss in this section. In Faraday’s  Law, the voltage is induced across a closed loop (and can be thought of as an ideal battery placed in the loop). This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 8 which shows a loop in the plane of the page, and a magnetic field out of the plane of the page.\n\n\n\nFigure 8:A varying magnetic field will induce a circular electric field.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nIn \n\nFigure 8, in order to produce the induced voltage as shown, is the magnetic field increasing or decreasing?\n\nThe magnetic field is increasing.\n\nThe magnetic field is decreasing.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nAs you recall, the electric potential difference between two points, A and B, is obtained from the electric field:\\Delta V = \\int_A^B \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l\n\nIn the case of an induced voltage across a loop, the points A and B are the same. The integral is thus over a closed path:\\Delta V = \\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l\n\nWe can include this into Faraday’s law by using the electric field instead of the potential difference:\\Delta V =-\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\\\\\\therefore \\;\\;\\boxed{\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}}\n\nwhere the last line is a more general form of Faraday’s law. Note that in the case of electrostatics, where the electric field is produced by a distribution of charges, the integral \\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l must be zero, since the electric force is conservative; the work done by the electric field on a charge q over a closed path, which is just a charge q multiplied by that integral, must be zero. The force from an electric field that is induced by a time-varying magnetic field is not conservative!\n\nFaraday’s law as expressed with the electric field is much more general, and implies that a time-varying magnetic field will induce an electric field. This is true, independently of there existing a physical wire to carry the induced current.\n\nExample 22.2\n\nA circular region with radius R contains a magnetic field that is uniform, and decreasing in magnitude with time:\\vec B(t) = B_0(1-at)\\hat z\n\nwhere a and B_0 are positive constants. Determine the electric field at a distance, r, from the centre of the region, inside and outside of the region with the magnetic field.\n\nSolution\n\nFigure 9 shows the circular region of magnetic field, as well as a circular path of radius r that defines the region over which we calculate the flux of the magnetic field.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:The induced electric field lines form closed circles when the magnetic field changes.\n\nFirst, we consider the induced electric field in the region with a magnetic field, where r<R. We choose a circle of radius r to calculate the flux of the magnetic field. Since the magnetic field is uniform within that region, the flux is given by:\\Phi_B = \\vec B \\cdot \\vec A = BA = B_0(1-at) \\pi r^2\n\nThe circulation of the electric field is easily found, since the electric field forms concentric circles (by symmetry):\\oint \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec l = \\oint Edl = E \\oint dl = E(2\\pi r)\n\nApplying Faraday’s law, the electric field is found to be:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l &= -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\\\\\nE(2\\pi r) &= -\\frac{d}{dt} B_0(1-at) \\pi r^2\\\\\n2E &=  B_0ar\\\\\n\\therefore E&=\\frac{B_0a}{2}r\\quad\\text{(inside the region of magnetic field)}\n\nand we see that, inside the region with the magnetic field, the strength of the induced electric field is proportional to the distance from the centre of the region (i.e. it increases linearly with r).\n\nFor the region where the magnetic field is zero, we again calculate the circulation of the electric field around a circular loop of radius r>R:\\oint \\vec E \\cdot d\\vec l = \\oint Edl = E \\oint dl = E(2\\pi r)\n\nThe flux of the magnetic field through that loop is however related to the area of the region with the magnetic field (of radius, R):\\Phi_B = \\vec B \\cdot \\vec A = BA = B_0(1-at) \\pi R^2\n\nAgain, applying Faraday’s law:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l &= -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\\\\\nE(2\\pi r) &= -\\frac{d}{dt} B_0(1-at) \\pi R^2\\\\\n2Er&=  B_0aR^2\\\\\n\\therefore E&=\\frac{B_0aR^2}{2r}\\quad\\text{(outside the region of magnetic field)}\n\nOutside the region with a magnetic field, the magnitude of the electric field decreases with the distance from the centre of the region.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we determined the electric field that is induced by a varying magnetic field. In this case, the electric field lines form closed circles and result in a non-conservative force. When the electric field is formed by a distribution of electric charges, the field lines begin and end on charges, which is not the case for an induced electric field.\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nYou’ll notice that this version of Faraday’s law has a very similar structure to Ampère 's law. Recall that Ampere’s law states:\\oint \\vec B \\cdot d\\vec l = \\mu_0I^{enc}\n\nThe difference is that now we have the circulation of the electric field rather than the magnetic field and instead of the enclosed current we are dealing with the rate of change of the enclosed flux. This is why, in the last example, we used an almost identical process to how we use Ampère 's law.","type":"content","url":"/induction#the-induced-electric-field-and-eddy-currents","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"Magnetic braking","lvl2":"The induced electric field and eddy currents"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/induction#magnetic-braking","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl3":"Magnetic braking","lvl2":"The induced electric field and eddy currents"},"content":"When a conducting material moves into a region of magnetic field, an electric field forming closed loops is induced in the material, thus inducing small current loops, called “eddy currents”. The magnetic field can then exert a force on those currents, effectively resulting in a force on the material. This is the principle behind magnetic braking, which is used in some trains and in other applications.\n\nFigure 10 illustrates how a magnetic brake can be used to slow a rotating wheel made of a conducting material (the material must conduct or the induced electric field will not produce any current). A magnetic field is produced (e.g. by a fixed permanent magnet) in a direction perpendicular to the wheel, over a small area (shown at the bottom of the wheel in \n\nFigure 10).\n\n\n\nFigure 10:A rotating wheel made of a conducting material has a small region with a magnetic field. The eddy currents in the region of changing flux result in a net downwards current at the centre of the region. The magnetic force that is exerted on that current slows down the wheel.\n\nFor material located at the bottom left of the wheel, the magnetic flux is increasing, since the material is moving from a region with no magnetic field into a region with a magnetic field. In that part of the region, clockwise eddy currents will form, as those result in a magnetic field into the page, to counter the increasing magnetic flux (Lenz’s law). The bottom right side of the wheel is leaving the magnetic field, and will thus have eddy currents in the opposite direction. The currents from both sides add up in the centre, resulting in a net downwards current. The magnetic force on that downwards current is to the left, resulting in a torque that slows the wheel. This is magnetic braking.\n\nAgain, this is no more than conservation of energy at play. Since we induce currents by making the wheel move into/out of a region of magnetic field, the electrical energy in those currents must come from somewhere (either we do work to keep the wheel rotating, or the wheel loses kinetic energy). Any time that we try to move a conductor through a magnetic field, in a way that current is induced, we will have to exert a force and do work. In the case of magnetic braking, the wheel will convert its rotational kinetic energy into heat (the eddy currents will heat up the wheel). The main issue with magnetic braking is that one needs to be able to dissipate the heat. The main advantage is that there are no parts that wear out, as opposed to braking with friction. In addition, magnetic braking is very smooth, and only acts when there is motion. As soon as the wheel stops rotating, the magnetic flux is constant everywhere and the eddy currents disappear.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nSuppose that the magnetic field in \n\nFigure 10 pointed into the page.

Transformers use electromagnetic induction to transform one alternating voltage into another. \n\nFigure 11 illustrates a transformer.\n\n\n\nFigure 11:A transformer converts a primary alternating voltage, \\Delta V_p, to a secondary alternating voltage, \\Delta V_s. The magnetic flux produced in one coil is transmitted by an iron core to the secondary coil, where a different voltage is induced, depending on the ratio of the number of windings in each coil.\n\nThe transformer has two coils, the “primary” and the “secondary”, with different numbers of loops, N_p and N_s, respectively. The coils are wrapped around an iron core, which can transmit the magnetic flux generated in the primary coil to the secondary coil. In the transformer, an alternating voltage, \\Delta V_p, is applied to the primary coil, and transformed into the desired voltage, \\Delta V_s, in the secondary coil.\n\nThe current in the primary coil creates a magnetic field. Those field lines are transmitted by the iron core into the second coil. A voltage is only induced in the secondary coil if the magnetic flux through the secondary coil changes with time. Thus, transformers only work with alternating voltages, so that the magnetic field created by the primary coil changes continuously.

The power plant produces power, P, and transmits it through the lines at a potential difference, \\Delta V, resulting in a current, I:P &= I\\Delta V\\\\\n\\therefore I &= \\frac{P}{\\Delta V}\n\nThe current, I, will dissipate power in the lines at a rate of:P_{line} = I^2 R = \\frac{P^2}{\\Delta V^2}R\n\nWith the two different voltages, this corresponds to:P_{line}&=\\frac{P^2}{\\Delta V^2}R=\\frac{(150e3 {\\rm W})^2}{(300000 {\\rm V})^2}(0.5 {\\rm \\Omega})=0.1 {\\rm W}\\\\\nP_{line}&=\\frac{P^2}{\\Delta V^2}R=\\frac{(150e3 {\\rm W})^2}{(300 {\\rm V})^2}(0.5 {\\rm \\Omega})=125000 {\\rm W}\\\\\n\nThus, when the power is transmitted at low voltage, more than 80% is dissipated in the transmission lines, whereas an insignificant fraction is dissipated when the power is transmitted at high voltage.

It is quite interesting to note the similarities and relations between the electric and magnetic field. Maxwell’s equations contain equations for the circulation and the total flux out of a closed surface for both fields. Ampère’s Law implies that a changing electric field will produce a magnetic field. Faraday’s law implies that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. If a point charge oscillates up and down, it will produce a changing electric field, which will produce a changing magnetic field, which will induce a changing magnetic field, etc. This is precisely what an electromagnetic wave is! The light that we see, the Wi-Fi signals for our phones, and the highly penetrating radiation from nuclear reactors are all examples of electromagnetic waves (of different wavelengths).\n\nIn fact, as Maxwell did, we can obtain the wave equation (\n\nSection 13.3.1) from Maxwell’s equations. We sketch out the derivation here, but it is definitely beyond the scope of this textbook. However, you’re so close to seeing one of the most exciting revelations of physics that it would be a shame to skip it!\n\nWe first write out Maxwell’s equations in differential form, as we have already shown for Gauss’ Law ((\n\nSection 16.5) and Ampère’s Law ((\n\nSection 21.4.1) \\nabla \\cdot \\vec E &= \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} &\\text{(Gauss' Law)}\\\\\n \\nabla \\cdot \\vec B&= 0 &\\text{(No magnetic monopoles)}\\\\\n \\nabla \\times \\vec B &= \\mu_0 \\left(\\vec j + \\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial\\vec E}{\\partial t}\\right) &\\text{(Ampère's Law)}\\\\\n \\nabla \\times \\vec E &= -\\frac{\\partial\\vec B}{\\partial t} &\\text{(Faraday's law)}\\\\\n\nIf we consider a vacuum region in space, with no charges and no currents, these equations reduce to:\\nabla \\cdot \\vec E &= 0 ~~~~&\\nabla \\cdot \\vec B&= 0\\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\vec B &= \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial\\vec E}{\\partial t} ~~~~& \\nabla \\times \\vec E &= -\\frac{\\partial\\vec B}{\\partial t}\n\nWe will make use of the following identity from vector calculus:\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec E)=\\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot \\vec E)-\\nabla^2\\vec E\n\nwhere:\\nabla^2\\vec E &= \\frac{\\partial^2 \\vec E}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 \\vec E}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\vec E}{\\partial z^2}\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2  E_x}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial z^2} \\right) \\hat x+ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2  E_y}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 E_y}{\\partial z^2} \\right) \\hat y \\\\\n&+ \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 E_z}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2  E_z}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 E_z}{\\partial z^2}  \\right) \\hat z\n\nis called the “vector Laplacian”.\n\nConsider taking the curl (\\nabla \\times) of the equation that has the curl of the electric field (Faraday’s law):\\nabla \\times \\bigg(\\nabla \\times \\vec E &= -\\frac{\\partial\\vec B}{\\partial t}\\bigg)\\\\\n\\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot \\vec E)-\\nabla^2\\vec E &= -\\nabla \\times \\frac{\\partial\\vec B}{\\partial t}\\\\\n-\\nabla^2\\vec E &= - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\nabla \\times \\vec B\\\\\n-\\nabla^2\\vec E &= - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\\\\n-\\nabla^2\\vec E &= - \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial^2\\vec E}{\\partial t^2}\n\nwhere, in the third line, we made use of Gauss’ Law (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec E=0), and, in the fourth line, Ampère’s Law (\\nabla \\times \\vec B = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}). The last equation that we obtained is a vector equation (the vector Laplacian has three components, as does the time-derivative of \\vec E on the right-hand side). Consider the x component of this equation:\\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2  E_x}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial z^2}  &= \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial t^2}\n\nIf we define the quantity:c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_0\\mu_0}}\n\nthen, the x component of the equation can be written as:\\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2  E_x}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial z^2} &= \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial t^2}\n\nwhich is exactly the wave equation for the component, E_x, of the electric field, propagating with speed c, the speed of light! Thus, the speed of light is directly related to the constants \\epsilon_0 and \\mu_0. You can write out similar equations for the y and z components of the electric field, and find the similar equations for the magnetic field if you start by taking the curl of Ampère’s Law instead of Faraday’s law.\n\nWe have just shown that electric and magnetic fields can behave as waves, which we now understand to be the waves that are responsible for light, radio waves, gamma rays, infra-red radiation, etc. All of these are types of electromagnetic waves with different frequencies. Although we did not demonstrate this, the electromagnetic waves that propagate are such that the magnetic and electric field vectors are always perpendicular to each other. Electromagnetic waves also carry energy. Thus, a charge that is oscillating (say on a spring) and creating an electromagnetic wave must necessarily be losing energy (or work must be done to keep the charge oscillating with the same amplitude). Finally, it is worth noting that, according to Quantum Mechanics, light (and the other frequencies of radiation), are really carried by particles called “photons”. Those particles are strange, since their propagation is described by a wave equation.","type":"content","url":"/induction#maxwells-equations-and-electromagnetic-waves","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/induction#summary","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"Faraday’s law connects a changing magnetic flux to an induced voltage:\\Delta V = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\nThe magnetic flux, \\Phi_B, is calculated as the flux of the magnetic field through an open surface, S:\\Phi_B = \\int_S \\vec B\\cdot d\\vec A\n\nThe induced voltage, \\Delta V, is the potential difference that is induced along the closed path (a “loop”) that bounds the surface, S. If a charge, q, were to move around that closed path, it would gain (or lose) energy, q\\Delta V. Note that the potential difference that is induced corresponds to a non-conservative electric force, as a charge can gain/lose energy by moving along a closed path. The induced voltage is often called an induced electromotive force (emf), even if it is a voltage.\n\nThe minus sign in Faraday’s law is sometime referred to as “Lenz’s law”, since it indicates in which direction the induced voltage will be. It is easiest to think of the closed path as a physical wire (e.g. a loop of wire) through which a current will be induced as a result of the induced voltage. The minus sign is easiest to interpret in terms of the relative direction between the area vector used to define the flux, and the magnetic dipole moment vector, \\vec \\mu, associated with the induced current (which points in the same direction as the magnetic field that is produced by the induced current).\n\nWhen calculating the flux of the magnetic field, the surface element vector d\\vec A, must be perpendicular to the surface through which the flux is calculated, which leads to two possible choices. Once a choice is made, and Faraday’s law has been applied, the sign of \\Delta V will indicate if the magnetic dipole moment of the induced current points in the same direction as d\\vec A (positive \\Delta V) or in the opposite direction (negative \\Delta V).\n\nIf N loops of wire are combined together into a coil, the voltages across each loop sum together, so that the voltage induced across the coil is given by:\\Delta V = -N\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\nLenz’s law is a statement about conservation of energy. Indeed, the induced current must create a magnetic field that opposes the change in flux, otherwise, the induced current would grow indefinitely. Lenz’s law can be summarized as follows:\n\nIf the magnitude of the magnetic flux is increasing in the loop, then the induced current produces a magnetic field that is in the opposite direction from the original magnetic field.\n\nIf the magnitude of the magnetic flux is decreasing in the loop, then the induced current produces a magnetic field that is in the same direction as the original magnetic field.\n\nA voltage is induced along a closed path any time that the flux of the magnetic field through the corresponding surface changes. The flux can change either because the magnetic field is changing, or because the loop is changing (in size or orientation relative to the magnetic field). In the latter case (changing loop), one speaks of a “motional emf”. A generator creates a motional emf by rotating a coil (with N loops, each with area, A), inside a fixed uniform magnetic field, \\vec B. The voltage produced by a generator is given by:\\Delta V = NAB\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)\n\nwhere ω is the angular speed of the coil. A generator thus produces alternating voltage/current. The current that is induced in the coil of the generator will dissipate energy as it flows through a resistance, R. Thus, one must do work in order to keep the generator spinning. The current induced in the coil of the generator will also result in a magnetic moment, and a “counter torque” will be exerted on the coil. One must thus exert a torque in order to keep the generator spinning (and the work done by exerting that torque is converted into the electrical energy dissipated in the resistor). The counter torque on the generator is always in the same direction, and has a magnitude:\\tau = \\frac{NA^2B^2\\omega\\sin^2(\\omega t)}{R}\n\nWhen an electric motor is used, a “back emf” is induced in the coil of the motor. The back emf is such that it resists the direction of current (Lenz’s law), or else the motor would spin infinitely fast. As the motor spins faster, the back emf grows, until it reaches an equilibrium. Motors thus draw a large current when they first start up, since at low speed, they have no back emf.\n\nSince a changing magnetic flux induces a voltage, an electric field is also induced. We can replace the voltage in Faraday’s law with the circulation of the electric field to write a more general version of Faraday’s law:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l &= -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\nThe induced electric field forms closed field lines, and is different than the electric field that is produced by static charges, since the latter will have field lines that start and end on charges. The force associated with the induced electric field is not conservative.\n\nWhen a metallic object passes through a region of magnetic field, the induced electric field will induce current loops in the material called eddy currents. The magnetic field will also exert a force on these eddy currents to oppose the motion that is creating the currents (Lenz’s law); as the eddy currents dissipate electrical energy in the material, the metallic object must lose kinetic energy unless a force is acting on it. Magnetic brakes make use of this principle.\n\nTransformers are used to convert an alternating voltage, \\Delta V_p, into a different alternating voltage, \\Delta V_s. A “primary” coil, with N_p windings, creates a changing magnetic flux that is guided (e.g. by an iron core) to a “secondary” coil, with N_s windings. The voltage induced in the secondary coil is given by:\\Delta V_s &= \\frac{N_p}{N_s}\\Delta V_p\n\nMaxwell’s four equations form our best classical theory of electromagnetism. Those equations imply that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field (Faraday’s law), while a changing electric field can produce a magnetic field (Ampère’s Law). By combining Maxwell’s equation (with some heavy vector calculus), one can show that this leads to the formation of electromagnetic waves, that propagate with a speed, c, given by:c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_0\\mu_0}}\n\nImportant Equations\n\nMagnetic flux:\\Phi_B = \\int_S \\vec B\\cdot d\\vec A\n\nFaraday’s law:\\Delta V = -N\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\nFaraday’s law:\\oint \\vec E\\cdot d\\vec l &= -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\nVoltage produced by a generator:\\Delta V = NAB\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)\n\nCounter torque on a generator:\\tau = \\frac{NA^2B^2\\omega\\sin^2(\\omega t)}{R}\n\nSecondary voltage in a transformer:\\Delta V_s &= \\frac{N_p}{N_s}\\Delta V_p","type":"content","url":"/induction#summary","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Thinking about the material"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/induction#thinking-about-the-material","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 22 - Electromagnetic induction","lvl2":"Thinking about the material"},"content":"Reflect and research\n\nWho first discovered induction?

As far as we can tell, this is the best description that we have of classical electric and magnetic phenomena (classical in the sense that the equations do not describe the behaviour of particles that are described by Quantum Mechanics). One of the consequences of Maxwell’s equations is that they describe the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate with a speed, c, given by:c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_0\\mu_0}}\n\nwhere \\epsilon_0 and \\mu_0 are the permittivity and permeability of free-space, respectively. We are familiar with waves that propagate through specific media. For example, ocean waves move through water and sound waves through air. The obvious question to ask about these electromagnetic waves is: “In what medium do these waves propagate?”. In the late 1800s, it was thought that the Universe was bathed in a substance called the “luminous ether” (or just “ether”), through which electromagnetic waves propagate. It was then thought that the speed, c, of these waves was, naturally, measured with respect to the ether. This led to the idea that there exists a special inertial frame of reference in the Universe, corresponding to that frame of reference in which light travels at a speed, c. This frame of reference would be at rest relative to the ether.\n\nIn the late 1880s, Michelson and Morley developed a clever experiment to measure the speed of the Earth relative to the ether. If the ether exists, and the Earth is moving through it, then a beam of light travelling parallel to the motion of the Earth should travel at a slightly different speed than a beam of light travelling in the perpendicular direction. However, Michelson and Morley conclusively demonstrated that this was not the case. There is no detectable motion of the Earth through a medium in which light (a electromagnetic wave) propagates. There is no ether. This was a very puzzling discovery, with strange implications for Maxwell’s equations.\n\nLet us demonstrate, through a simple example, an “issue” with the theory of electromagnetism. Rather, it is not an issue, but a very strange implication. Consider two infinitely-long wires, separated by a distance, r, each carrying a uniform charge per unit length, λ, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Two infinitely long charged wires exert a repulsive electric force on each other.\n\nWe can easily calculate the magnitude of the repulsive electric force, \\vec F_E, exerted by one charged wire on a section of length l of the other wire. The magnitude of the electric field at a distance, r, from an infinitely-long wire with charge per unit length λ is given by:E = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}\n\nA section of length l of the other wire carries charge, q=l\\lambda, so that the force on that section of wire has a magnitude:F_E=qE=\\lambda l \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda^2 l}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}\n\nAnd the force per unit length, on either one of the wires, has a magnitude:\\frac{F_E}{l}=\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}\n\nThis is the only force exerted on one of the wires, and will thus allow us to completely specify the motion of that wire (we know all of the forces exerted on the wire, so we can use Newton’s Second Law to determine its acceleration and describe its motion).\n\nConsider the same two wires, each carrying a charge per unit length, as viewed from a frame of reference that is moving downwards (parallel to the wires), with a speed, v. In this frame of reference, the infinite wires still have a net charge per unit length, but they also appear to have an upwards moving current, I, since we observe positive charges moving upwards through space.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Two infinitely-long charged wires as viewed from a down-going frame of reference will appear to have upwards-going currents that will result in an attractive magnetic force between the wires.\n\nIn this new frame of reference, we see two wires with charges on them, moving upwards with speed, v. In an interval of time, \\Delta t, we see a length of wire, \\Delta x=v\\Delta t, go by, with total charge, \\Delta Q=\\lambda' \\Delta x. For reasons that will be clear below, we use a different charge density, \\lambda', in the moving frame of reference, although we expect that \\lambda'=\\lambda. This corresponds to a current, I, given by:I=\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}=\\lambda'\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\lambda' v\n\nThus, in the downward going frame of reference, we see two wires with upwards current in them, and these wires must extract an attractive magnetic force between each other, with magnitude (per unit length):\\frac{F'_B}{l} = -\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1I_2}{2\\pi r}=-\\frac{\\mu_0 I^2}{2\\pi r}=-\\frac{\\mu_0 \\lambda'^2 v^2}{2\\pi r}\n\nwhere the prime (') on the force indicates that the force is measured in this different inertial frame of reference, and the minus sign indicates that it is in the opposite direction from the repulsive electric force.\n\nIn the downwards going frame of reference, the wires are still charged, and must still exert a repulsive electric force, with magnitude (per unit length):\\frac{F'_E}{l}=\\frac{\\lambda'^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}\n\nwhere, again, we used primes ('), to denote quantities that are measured in the moving frame of reference.\n\nThe description of how the wires will move should not depend on the frame of reference in which we choose to model the wires (they will move under the forces exerted on them regardless of whether we are observing them from a fixed or a moving point, and indeed regardless of whether we observe them at all!). Thus, the net force (per unit length) exerted on a wire cannot depend on our frame of reference. The total repulsive electric force, F_E, calculated in the stationary frame of reference must be equal to the sum of the magnetic and electric forces, F'_B and F'_E, calculated in the moving frame of reference :\\frac{F_E}{l}&=\\frac{F'_E}{l}+\\frac{F'_B}{l}\\\\\n\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}&=\\frac{\\lambda'^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}  -\\frac{\\mu_0 \\lambda'^2 v^2}{2\\pi r}\n\nwhere we recognized that the charge per unit length, \\lambda', must be different in the moving frame of reference, or the above would give an inconsistent equation (the electric forces would cancel and we would find that the magnetic force is equal to zero). Thus, the repulsive electric force must be larger as observed in the moving frame of reference, or the net force on the wire would be different when evaluated in the two frames of reference. This is a truly bizarre conclusion, as we will see.\n\nBefore proceeding, let us clearly state our assumptions in modelling the force between the two charged wires:\n\nThe net force on the wire, allowing us to describe its motion, cannot depend on our frame of reference. We expect the laws of physics to be applicable from any inertial frame of reference.\n\nWe assume that Maxwell’s equations hold in all inertial frames of reference. In particular, we assume that the constants, \\mu_0 and \\epsilon_0, are the same in all inertial reference frames.\n\nThe first assumption allows us to state that the net force in the two frames of reference must be the same. The second assumption implies that we must change the charge density, \\lambda', in the moving frame of reference, since the constants must remain the same, and this is the only quantity that can lead to a different electric force in the moving frame of reference (which is required if the net force is to be the same, according to our first assumption). Let us determine the new charge density, \\lambda', in terms of the charge density that is measured at rest. Starting with the requirement that the net force on the wire must not depend on the frame of reference, we find:\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}&=\\frac{\\lambda'^2}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0r}  -\\frac{\\mu_0 \\lambda'^2 v^2}{2\\pi r}\\\\\n\\lambda^2&=\\lambda'^2-\\epsilon_0\\mu_0\\lambda'^2 v^2\\\\\n\\lambda^2&=\\lambda'^2(1-\\epsilon_0\\mu_0v^2)\\\\\n\\therefore \\lambda'&=\\lambda \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_0\\mu_0-v^2}}\n\nFinally, recognizing that we can use the speed of light, c, to replace the combination of constants, \\epsilon_0\\mu_0, we find:\\lambda'&=\\lambda \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\nThus, the charge per unit length on the wire is larger when measured from the moving frame of reference (\\lambda' is greater than λ if v<c). It should be somewhat bothersome to you that the charge per unit length depends on the frame of reference in which it is measured, but this is the only way for our two assumptions to hold.\n\nSo far, this has just been some math to ensure that “things work out”, namely that our description of the motion of the wire does not depend on our frame of reference. However, the consequences of what we just derived are profound. We concluded that the charge per unit length on a wire depends on our frame of reference.\n\nSince we are dealing with infinitely long wires, we can draw two lines to define a section of the wire in the rest frame, as in \n\nFigure 3. The charge per unit length on the wire, λ, is found by counting the number of charges between the two lines and dividing that by the distance between the two lines. Now, both an observer at rest relative to the wire, and one that is moving relative to the wire will agree on the number of charges contained between the two lines. They will both count the same number. Thus, if the observer moving relative to the wire is to measure a larger charge density, then the distance between the lines must be smaller for that observer! To the observer moving relative to the wire, the wire is actually shorter. It does not appear to be shorter, it IS shorter!\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Two infinitely-long charged wires as viewed from a rest frame and a moving frame. In order for the charge density to be greater in the moving reference frame, the wire must be shorter. For an infinitely long wire, this is depicted by showing that if we use two lines (red dashed lines) to define a section of wire in the rest frame, those lines will be closer together in the moving frame.\n\nTo summarize, by requiring that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, and by requiring that Maxwell’s equations are the same in all inertial frames of reference, we conclude that the charge per unit length that is measured on a wire must depend on the frame of reference in which it is measured. Since it cannot be the number of charges on the wire that depends on the frame of reference, it must be the length of the wire that depends on the frame of reference. Thus, either we accept that Maxwell’s equations are incorrect, or we accept that they are correct but that they imply that objects shrink in length when they are moving (regardless of whether charges are involved). It turns out that the latter choice provides a better description of nature (and one that has not been invalidated!).\n\nAn additional consequence of accepting these implications from Maxwell’s equations is that the definition of the electric and magnetic fields must depend on the frame of reference. In the example from this section, we saw that what looks like an electric field in the stationary frame of reference can appear as the combination of a magnetic and electric fields in a moving frame of reference.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#introduction-the-issue-with-maxwells-equations","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Einstein’s postulates"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#einsteins-postulates","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Einstein’s postulates"},"content":"Two postulates\nSimulataneity\n\nAlbert Einstein was the first to provide a complete description of how to deal with the issues that arise from Maxwell’s equations when these are examined in different inertial frames of reference.

There is no experiment that can be performed to determine whether one is at rest or moving with constant velocity.\n\nThe speed of light propagating in vacuum is the same in all inertial reference frames. Any observer in an inertial frame of reference, regardless of their velocity, will measure that light has a speed of c when it propagates in vacuum.\n\nThese postulates are equivalent to the assumptions that we made above to model the force between the two wires (we stated that the constants, \\epsilon_0 and \\mu_0, were independent of the reference frame, instead of c). While the first postulate is perhaps “acceptable” to our common sense, the second one grossly defies common intuition. Consider two archers, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Two archers can fire an arrow with speed v_A. As measured in the frame of reference of the ground (of the target), the arrow fired from the archer that is on the train will have a higher speed.\n\nBoth archers can fire an arrow with speed v_A. One archer fires her arrow from the ground, and that arrow will hit its target with speed v_A. The other archer is on a train that is moving with speed v in the same direction that she wishes to shoot her arrow. She measures her arrow to leave her bow with speed v_A, but, as seen from the ground (and from the target), her arrow has a speed v_A+v, and it will hit the target with a higher speed, as expected.\n\nNow, consider two people that instead fire a pulse of laser light at a target on the ground, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Two people fire a laser pulse. Regardless of whether the pulse of laser light was fired from a moving train or from the ground, it will have a speed of c in all frames of reference.\n\nIn this case, according to Einstein’s second postulate, the speed of the pulses as measured on the ground (by the target), will be c, regardless of whether one of the pulses was fired from a moving train. This is truly strange and not compatible with our experience. For example, imagine that the train moves close to the speed of light. The person on the train would fire a laser pulse that he would observe to move away from him at the speed of light. However, when observed from the ground, we would see the pulse of light move away from them very slowly.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#einsteins-postulates","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Simultaneity","lvl2":"Einstein’s postulates"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/specialrelativity#simultaneity","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Simultaneity","lvl2":"Einstein’s postulates"},"content":"As a first consequence of Einstein’s postulates, let us consider the notion of simultaneity. \n\nFigure 6 shows Alice on the platform of a train station. Alice is midway between two clocks, A and B. Both identical clocks were configured so that they send a pulse of laser light when the time is 20 minutes past four o’clock. Since Alice is midway between the clocks, if they emit their pulses of light at the same time, then Alice will see two pulses of light arrive at her location at the same time. She signals that the two pulses of light have reached her at the same time by raising her hands.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Alice is equidistant from two clocks. The clocks fire a laser pulse when the time is 20 past four, and Alice observes both pulses arriving at her location at the same time, concluding that the pulses were emitted by the clocks at the same time.\n\nBrice is located on a train that is travelling with speed, v, in the direction from clock A to clock B, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 7. He sees Alice and the platform moving towards him.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:Brice is on a moving train, and, from his perspective, it is Alice and the platform that are moving towards him. Brice must conclude that the pulse from clock B was emitted earlier, since it must travel further than the pulse emitted from clock A to reach Alice at the same time.\n\nBrice must agree that the two pulses arrived at Alice’s location at the same time, since he can also see her raise her hands. In Brice’s frame of reference, the two pulses of light must travel with the speed of light (Einstein’s second postulate). Once the pulse of light has been emitted from clock B, Brice observes that Alice is moving away from the location of where the pulse was emitted, so that pulse must travel a large distance, d_B. On the other hand, once the pulse from clock A is emitted, Brice observes that Alice moves towards where the pulse was emitted, so it only needs to travel a shorter distance, d_A, in order to reach Alice. Thus, for both pulses to arrive at Alice at the same time and travel at the speed of light, the pulse from clock B had to be emitted first, according to Brice.\n\nThat is, while Alice measures the clocks to be synchronized and emit pulses at the same time, Brice measures that clock B is running ahead of clock A. The two observers, Alice and Brice, in different reference frames, cannot agree on whether two events are simultaneous. Even worse, if a third observer, \\chloens, is located on a train going in the opposite direction from Brice’s train, she will conclude that the pulse from clock A was emitted earlier than the pulse from clock B. A consequence of Einstein’s postulates is that observers in different frames of reference will not agree on whether two events happen at the same time, and in some cases, as the one we illustrated, the observers will not agree on which event happened first. Think of the implications for causality!","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#simultaneity","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Time dilation"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#time-dilation","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Time dilation"},"content":"Einstein was famous for his “thought experiments”, which allow us to understand the consequences of a theory by performing thought experiments that would be impractical to actually carry out (such as the experiment with Alice and Brice described above, which would be impractical to carry out, since the speed of light is so high that Brice would never notice that clock A emitted the pulse slightly earlier).\n\nImagine that we build a clock using a pulse of light travelling (oscillating) back and forth between two mirrors, separated by a distance, L, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 8.\n\n\n\nFigure 8:A clock is made by having a pulse of light bounce back and forth between two parallel mirrors separated by a distance, L.\n\nSince the speed of light is c, the time that it will take for the pulse of light to travel back and forth between the two mirrors, namely the period of the clock, is given by:\\Delta t = \\frac{2L}{c}\n\nwhere the speed of light, c, is given by the total distance travelled by the pulse of light divided by the time taken to do so:c=\\frac{2L}{\\Delta t}\n\nNow, imagine placing this clock on a spaceship that travels with speed v, perpendicular to the direction of the movement of the light. The clock is illustrated in \n\nFigure 9, as seen from the ground.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:A clock is made by having a pulse of light bounce back and forth between two parallel mirrors separated by a distance, L. When the clock is placed on a spaceship moving with speed, v, the light travels a longer distance before completing a full cycle, as observed by someone not travelling with the clock.\n\nFrom the perspective of a person watching the clock go by, the pulse of light travels a larger distance over one clock period, since the mirrors move to the right as the pulse of light moves up and down. However, by Einstein’s second postulate, the pulse of light must still travel with the same speed, c, so it must take the pulse of light longer to bounce between the two mirrors than it did when the clock is at rest. Let us determine the relationship between the period of the clock, \\Delta t, measured when the clock is at rest, and the period of the clock, \\Delta t', as measured by an observer that sees the clock go by with speed, v.\n\nTo an observer that sees the clock move by with speed, v, the speed of the pulse of light, which must also be equal to c, is given by:c&=\\frac{2\\sqrt{L^2+\\left(\\frac{v\\Delta t'}{2}\\right)^2}}{\\Delta t'}\n\nwhere the distance in the numerator was simply found by Pythagoras’ theorem, as the spaceship will travel a horizontal distance, v\\Delta t', as measured by the observer that is not moving with the spaceship. Squaring this relationship, we can isolate the period of the clock, \\Delta t', as measured by the observer that sees the clock move with speed, v:c^2&=\\frac{4L^2}{\\Delta t'^2}+v^2\\\\\n\\Delta t'^2 (c^2-v^2)&=4L^2\\\\\n\\therefore \\Delta t' &= 2L\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c^2-v^2}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2L}{c}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\nNote that the term 2L/c is simply the period of the clock as measured in a frame of reference where the clock is stationary. Thus, we can relate the two clock periods:\\boxed{\\Delta t' = \\Delta t \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}\n\nTo re-iterate: the period of the clock, \\Delta t', as measured in a frame of reference that is moving relative to the clock is longer than the period of the clock, \\Delta t, as measured in the “rest frame” of the clock (the reference frame where the clock is stationary). We call this effect “time dilation”, and it is not just some mathematical curiosity. The clock that we imagined with a pulse of light is a real clock that one could actually construct; we could use it to measure time. That clock will appear to tick slower if it is moving. Time goes by slower in a moving reference frame. If a person climbs on a ship that is moving, that person will age at a slower rate than a person that remained on Earth. By travelling at high speeds, you effectively travel into the future, as observed on Earth. The equation above allows us to relate the amount of time that went by in one reference frame to the amount of time that went by in a different frame of reference.\n\nWe define the time that is measured at rest as the “proper time”. In our example, \\Delta t is the proper time (proper period) for the clock, since it is defined in a frame of reference where the clock is at rest. The “dilated time”, \\Delta t', is measured in a frame of reference that is moving relative to the clock.\n\nThe factor by which time is dilated comes up often in Special Relativity, and is called the gamma factor:\\boxed{\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}\n\nAs a corollary to Einstein’s postulates, we will see that nothing can ever exceed the speed of light in vacuum. The gamma factor is always greater than one, since v (the speed between the two different inertial frames of reference) must always be smaller than c. You may also recognize that the gamma factor appeared in our introductory example with the force between two wires. Here, we derived the gamma factor from kinematic considerations, whereas in the example with the two wires, it came straight out of the equations for electromagnetism.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat is gamma for a speed of v=0.75c?\n\n1.51\n\n0.75\n\n75\n\n1.68\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat speed, v, corresponds to a gamma factor of 2.5?\n\nv=2.5c\n\nv=0.92c\n\nv=0.25c\n\nv=0.47c\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nTime-dilation is a real effect that has been observed, for example, by placing high precision atomic clocks on an airplane to observe their period slow down. Another example of time-dilation is the fact that we observe many particles called muons at the surface of the Earth. Muons are very similar to electrons, except that they have a larger mass, and that they are unstable (they radioactively decay into an electron and neutrinos, after 2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} on average). Muons are produced in large amounts when cosmic rays (high energy particles from outside our Solar System) strike the molecules in our upper atmosphere, at altitudes of tens of kilometres. As the muons travel down towards the Earth, they decay.\n\nSuppose that muons are produced travelling at the speed of light; in that case, they would travel a distance d=(3\\times 10^{8} {\\rm m/s})(2.2\\times 10^{-6} {\\rm s})=660 {\\rm m}, on average, before decaying. However, muons are produced tens of kilometres above the surface of the Earth, travel slower than the speed of light, and yet, we are able to detect many muons at the surface of the Earth. We would expect that all muons would have decayed before reaching the surface of the Earth.\n\nWe can understand this in terms of time dilation; in the reference frame of the muon, the muon decays after \\Delta t=2.2 {\\rm \\mu s}. In a reference frame from which the muon appears to move with speed v, the “clock” that measures how long the muon has existed ticks slower. Thus, from the Earth, we observe that the muon takes longer than 2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} to decay, giving it time to reach the surface of the Earth.\n\nExample 23.1\n\nA muon travels with a speed of 0.9c as observed from the surface of the Earth. As measured in the frame of reference of the Earth, how far has the muon travelled after 2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} have elapsed in the muon’s frame of reference?\n\nSolution\n\nThe muon is travelling with a speed of v=0.9c relative to the Earth, thus the gamma factor is given by:\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0.9^2}}=2.29\n\nThe amount of time that goes by in the frame of reference of the Earth, \\Delta t, when \\Delta t'=2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} has gone by in the muon’s frame of reference will be dilated by the gamma factor. \\Delta t' is the proper time in the muon frame’s of reference, which corresponds to a longer time in Earth’s frame of reference:\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta t' = (2.29)(2.2 {\\rm \\mu s})=5.0 {\\rm \\mu s}\n\nIn the frame of reference of the Earth, the muon has travelled a distance:d' = v\\Delta t'=(0.8c)(5.0 {\\rm \\mu s})=1350 {\\rm m}\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we see that an object, such as a muon, that travels with at 90 percent of the speed of light will have a gamma factor around 2. Thus, from the Earth’s frame of reference, it appears that the muon “ages” at about half of the rate at which one would observe the muon to age if moving along with the muon. This is the mechanism that allows muons to exist much longer than 2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} when they are travelling relative to the Earth.\n\nAlso, in Earth’s reference frame, the muon travels a distance of 1350 {\\rm m} in the period of time between being produced and decaying. In the reference frame of the muon, only 2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} elapse as the Earth moves closer to the muon, at the same speed. In the reference frame of the muon, the Earth has travelled a distance:d' = v\\Delta t=(0.9c)(2.2 {\\rm \\mu s})=594 {\\rm m}\n\nThus, as viewed from the muon’s frame of reference, the distance that it travelled between being produced and decaying is about half the distance as measured in the Earth’s reference frame. This is called “length contraction” and is a necessary consequence of time-dilation.\n\nExample 23.2\n\nA spaceship carrying your friend Alice speeds away at a speed of 0.99c towards the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, a distance of 4.2 {\\rm ly} (light-years) away. How much time does the trip take as measured by Alice? How far has the spaceship travelled, according to Alice?}\nAlice’s trip is illustrated in \n\nFigure 10, showing the trip as viewed from Earth’s and from Alice’s frame of reference.\n\n\n\nFigure 10:Alice travels in a spaceship from the Earth to the star Proxima Centauri. In the Earth frame of reference, the star is 4.2 {\\rm ly} away.\n\nSolution\n\nIn Earth’s frame of reference, the spaceship travels a distance of 4.2 {\\rm ly} at a speed of 0.99c, which will take a time, \\Delta t', given by:\\Delta t' = \\frac{(4.2 {\\rm ly})}{(0.99c)}=4.2 {\\rm y}\n\nwhich is not surprising, since Alice is travelling at almost the speed of light. This is the time that goes by on planet Earth. Since Alice’s spaceship is moving, less time will go by on the spaceship, as the 4.2 {\\rm y} is the dilated time measured at Earth, not the proper time measured by Alice. First, we determine the gamma factor:\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0.99^2}}=7.1\n\nThe proper time measured by Alice is:\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta t'}{\\gamma}=\\frac{(4.2 {\\rm y})}{(7.1)}=0.6 {\\rm y}\n\nThat is, Alice only ages by 0.6 {\\rm y} (about 7 months), while everyone on Earth ages by 4.2 {\\rm y}!In Alice’s frame of reference, she is not moving, and Proxima Centauri moves towards her at a speed of 0.99c. Since her trip only lasts about 7 months (0.6 {\\rm y}), Proxima Centauri moves towards her by a distance, L':L'=v\\Delta t=(0.99c)(0.6 {\\rm y})=0.6 {\\rm ly}\n\nas illustrated in \n\nFigure 10. Thus, Alice concludes that the distance between Earth and Proxima Centauri is only 0.6 {\\rm ly} instead of 4.2 {\\rm ly}. The distance that she observes is contracted compared to the “proper distance” between Earth and Proxima (the distance measured when we are at rest relative to Earth and Proxima).\n\nDiscussion: In this example we saw, again, how the time that one measures depends on the frame of reference. In particular, if one can build spaceships that goes close to the speed of light, one can cover large distances in the Universe without ageing much. We also saw that length contraction is a necessary corollary to time-dilation. Objects appear contracted when they move, relative to their length when they are measured at rest (their “rest length” or their “proper length”).\n\nOne interesting issue uncovered by \n\nExample 23.2 is the so-called “twin-paradox”. Imagine that Alice has a twin brother, Brice, that remains on Earth. Alice travels to Proxima Centauri and back (return trip), and will have aged by about 14 months, whereas Brice, will have aged by about 8.4 years (using the numbers in \n\nExample 23.2). However, Einstein’s first postulate implies that there are no special frames of reference that are at rest. We should be able to think about this situation from the perspective where Alice is at rest, and it is the Earth (with Brice on it), that moves away from her and then back. In this case, Alice is at rest, and she will conclude that it takes about 8.4 years for Brice to move away and come back, and that Brice would have aged by about 7 months. When Alice and Brice meet up again, clearly Alice cannot be both younger and older than Brice, so which one is it? (You will have to look this up, see associated question in the “Thinking about the material” section).","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#time-dilation","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Length contraction"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#length-contraction","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Length contraction"},"content":"As we saw in the examples from the previous section, time dilation implies “length contraction”. When an object is measured in a frame of reference that is at rest relative to the object, the length of the object, L, is called the “rest length” or the “proper length” of the object. If that object is moving relative to an observer, the observer will measure the object to be shorter, and have a “contracted length”, L', given by:\\boxed{L'=L\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} =\\frac{L}{\\gamma}}\n\nIn \n\nExample 23.2, Alice measured a contracted distance between Earth and Proxima Centauri, as she was in a frame of reference that is moving relative to the Earth-Proxima Centauri reference frame. One point that is important to note is that length contraction only occurs along the direction parallel to the direction of motion.\n\nExample 23.3\n\nA square painting hanging in a museum has a side with a length of 1 {\\rm m}. If you view the stationary painting from a train moving in the horizontal direction at a speed of 0.85c, what is the surface area of the painting that you measure?\n\nSolution\n\nSince your train is moving horizontally, only the horizontal dimension of the painting will be contracted. The gamma factor is given by:\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0.85^2}}=1.9\n\nThus, the horizontal side of the painting will have a contracted length:L'=\\frac{L}{\\gamma}=\\frac{(1 {\\rm m})}{(1.9)}=0.53 {\\rm m}\n\nThe area of the painting, as measured in the moving frame of reference, is given by:A= (1 {\\rm m})(0.53 {\\rm m})=0.53 {\\rm m^2}\n\nCheckpoint\n\nAt what speed must an object travel in order for it to appear 1% shorter?\n\n0.01c\n\n0.04c\n\n0.99c\n\n0.65c\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nIn these types of problems, it is important to keep track of which reference frame gives us the proper length and which gives us the proper time. I recommend taking a minute at the beginning of each problem to think about this, and jot it down at the start of your solution. Take \n\nFigure 10, in which our friend Alice travels from Earth to Proxima Centuri on a spaceship. We are dealing with Earth’s frame of reference, which I will call E, and the Alice’s frame of reference, which I will call A. We are interested in the time elapsed on the spaceship and the distance to Proxima Centuri. The Earth is moving relative to the spaceship’s clock and is stationary relative to Proxima Centuri. Thus, frame E gives us the dilated time, \\Delta t', and the proper length, L. Alice is stationary relative to the spaceship’s clock and is moving relative to Proxima Centuri. Thus, frame A gives us the proper time, \\Delta t, and the contracted length, L'.At the top of my solution, I would write:\\textrm{Frame}\\, E: L, \\Delta t'\\\\\n\\textrm{Frame}\\, A: L', \\Delta t\n\nTo check that we got this right, the speed of the spaceship should not change depending on the reference frame. In the Earth’s frame of reference, the velocity is given by v=L/\\Delta t'. In Alice’s frame, it is given by v=L'/\\Delta t, or, using the gamma factor:  v=(L/\\gamma)/(\\Delta t'/\\gamma)=L/\\Delta t', as expected.\n\nLength contraction also allows us to discuss a famous paradox (the “barn”, or “ladder” or “barn-pole” paradox). Consider a train that has a rest length of 500 {\\rm m}, travelling at a speed such that \\gamma = 2.5. As the train goes by, from Earth, it appears to have a (contracted) length:L'_{train}=\\frac{(500 {\\rm m})}{2.5}=200 {\\rm m}\n\nSuppose that there is a tunnel on Earth that is exactly 200 {\\rm m} long, so that the train, when contracted, will fit in the tunnel. When the train passes, an operator briefly closes (and re-opens) the doors at the ends of the tunnel, briefly “capturing” the train, and since the train is contracted, it never hits any of the doors, and all is fine.\n\nFrom the train’s frame of reference, the train has a proper length of 500 {\\rm m}, and the tunnel is contracted to a length of:L'_{tunnel}=\\frac{(200 {\\rm m})}{(2.5)}=80 {\\rm m}\n\nThus, from the train’s perspective, if the doors of the tunnel are closed, there is no way that the 500 {\\rm m} long train can ever fit in the 80 {\\rm m} long tunnel, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 11. So what happens when the operator on Earth closes the doors of the tunnel to briefly “capture” the train?\n\n\n\nFigure 11:In the ground’s reference frame, the contracted train appears to fit inside the tunnel. From the train, the (proper length) train will not fit in the contracted tunnel.\n\nClearly, people on the Earth and people on the train have to agree on whether the train was destroyed by the tunnel doors. The operator on Earth can clearly close both doors of the tunnel when the train is inside and not destroy the train. Hence, people on the train must agree that the train never collided with the doors, and that the doors were closed. The answer to this paradox lies in the fact that simultaneity is relative. The tunnel operator believes that she has closed the two doors of the tunnel at exactly the same time, precisely when the contracted train is lined up with the tunnel. However, to people on the train, in a different frame of reference, the doors did not close at the same time, since events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are not necessarily simultaneous in a different frame of reference. To people on the train, there was never a time when the train was in the tunnel and both doors were closed at the same time!\n\nCheckpoint\n\nReferring to the above paradox, to people on the train, which tunnel door closes first?\n\nThe door at the entrance of the tunnel closes first.\n\nThe door at the exit of the tunnel closes first.\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#length-contraction","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Electric and magnetic fields and Special Relativity"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#electric-and-magnetic-fields-and-special-relativity","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Electric and magnetic fields and Special Relativity"},"content":"In this section, we present one more example to show how Special Relativity is connected to electromagnetism. Consider a wire that carries an electric current towards the left, and a positive charge, +Q, located next to the wire, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 12.\n\n\n\nFigure 12:A stationary positive charge, +Q, near a wire carrying current towards the left. This leads to a magnetic field out of the page at the location of Q+.\n\nInside the wire, negative electrons are moving towards the right with a drift velocity, \\vec v_d, while positive ions remain stationary. Since the charge +Q has a velocity of zero, it experiences no magnetic force. Furthermore, the wire appears to be neutral, with no net electric charge.\n\nIf the charge, +Q, has a velocity, \\vec v_d, towards the right, it will experience a downwards magnetic force, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 13.\n\n\n\nFigure 13:A positive charge, +Q, moving towards the right, near a wire carrying current towards the left, will experience a downwards magnetic force, \\vec F_B=Q \\vec v_d\\times \\vec B.\n\nNow, consider this from the perspective of the charge, +Q, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 14. The charge Q is moving towards the right at the same speed as the electrons in the wire. In the reference frame of the charge, +Q, the charge has a velocity of zero, and thus will experience no magnetic force. The wire still appears to have a (different) current, I', as the positive ions move to the left, creating a magnetic field, \\vec B', out of the page.\n\nIn the “lab” frame of reference, where the electrons and the charge +Q move towards the right at the same speed, v_d, the electrons appear closer together (length contracted) than they are in the frame of reference of the electrons (or of the charge +Q, since it is moving with the electrons). In the frame of reference of the charge +Q, the electrons thus appear to be spaced further apart (less dense). On the other hand, in the frame of reference of +Q, the positive ions, which are moving towards the left, appear closer together, as the distance between them is now contracted, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 14.\n\n\n\nFigure 14:In the frame of reference of the charge +Q, the charge has a velocity of zero and cannot experience a magnetic force. The ions appear to move to the left, and thus appear denser, since the distance between ions is contracted. The distance between electrons, on the other hand, is larger in this frame of reference. It thus appears that the wire is positively charged, and would exert a downwards electric force on the charge, +Q.\n\nIn the frame of reference of the charge +Q, the wire no longer appears neutral, but appears to have a net positive charge. This results in an electric field away from the wire that will exert a downwards force on +Q. In both frames of reference, we conclude that the charge will experience a downwards force. Whether that force is magnetic or electric depends on the frame of reference! Here, we came to the conclusion by using the notion of length contraction, but remember that length contraction itself is a consequence of Maxwell’s equations holding in different frames of reference, as we illustrated at the beginning of this chapter.\n\nIn most real-world applications, we do not see the effects of Special Relativity, as the speeds involved must be very high for the gamma factor to be appreciably greater than one. However, we see these effects in electromagnetism even though the drift speed of electrons in a wire is usually (much) less than {\\rm mm/s}. This is because, when dealing with the electric and magnetic forces (fields), even a minuscule length contraction of the electrons/ions at those speeds leads to relativistic effects. This can be thought of in terms of how strong the electric force really is; even a minute change in charge density (due to length contraction) has a sizeable relativistic effect.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#electric-and-magnetic-fields-and-special-relativity","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#lorentz-transformations-and-space-time","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"content":"%%Lorentz transformations, space time diagrams","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#lorentz-transformations-and-space-time","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Four-dimensional space-time","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/specialrelativity#four-dimensional-space-time","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Four-dimensional space-time","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"content":"So far, we have seen that our notions of time intervals (the time between two events) and space intervals (the distance between two locations) depend on our frame of reference.

Additionally, we concluded that there is no absolute concept of time, and that time is relative.\n\nIn the context of Special Relativity, we introduce the concept of space-time. To describe the location of an object in space-time, we must specify both the location/position coordinates (x, y, z) and the time “coordinate”, t.

However, we can gain a lot of insight into Special Relativity models by using “space-time diagrams”. In a space-time diagram, we use only one of the space coordinates (typically x) along with the time coordinate, ct, to define the two axes of a space-time diagram. Space-time diagrams are analogous to “position as a function of time” graphs that one would draw in kinematics, although they are fundamentally different in that, for a space-time diagram, the coordinates should be thought of as independent (one is not plotting a dependent variable as a function of an independent variable).\n\nFigure 15 shows a space-time diagram for an object that was located at position x=x_1 at time t=t_1 (location A), and at position x=x_2 at time t=t_2 (location B). The path of an object through space-time, indicated by the line that connects A and B, is called the “world line” of the object.\n\n\n\nFigure 15:World line of an object that moved from locations A in space-time to location B in space-time.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nWhat does the world-line of a stationary particle look like?\n\nA vertical line.\n\nA horizontal line.\n\nA point.\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nA pulse of light travelling in the x direction will always have a world-line that makes a 45 {\\rm \\degree} angle with the horizontal (space) axis (since x=ct). The world line of any object that travels with a speed below the speed of light must always make an angle with the horizontal axis that is greater than 45 {\\rm \\degree}.\n\nA position in space-time is usually called an “event”. We can draw a set of lines, at 45 {\\rm \\degree} degrees from the horizontal axis, that intersect at an event in space-time. Those lines define two “light cones” corresponding to: (1) locations in space-time in the past that could have had a causal effect on the event (the “past light cone”), and (2), locations in space-time in the future for which the event can have a causal effect (the “future light cone”).\n\nFigure 16 shows the light cones associated with an event, A, in space-time. The past light cone is the only region of space-time in which a different event could have had an impact on the event A. For example, the event A might be that “the object is at position x=x_1 at time t=t_1”, so that the past light cone corresponds to the only locations in space-time that the object could have been in the past. Similarly, the future light-cone defines the locations in space-time upon which the event A could have an effect. For example, this could define the possible locations of the object in the future. The regions outside the light cones can never have an effect on the event A; they are not causally connected. A signal or object would need to travel faster than the speed of light in order to have an effect on something outside of its light cone. There are locations in space-time, in the future of our Universe, that we cannot influence, no matter what we do.\n\n\n\nFigure 16:The past and future light cones associated with the space-time event, A.\n\nWhen two events in space-time are within each other’s light cones, we say that the space-time interval between them (the line that you draw from one event to the other) is “time-like”. Time-like events are such that all observers, in any frame of reference, will agree that one event happened before the other. Thus, events that are causally related must have a time-like interval between them (they are connected by a line that makes an angle greater than 45 {\\rm \\degree} with the horizontal axis).\n\nTwo events that are outside of each other’s light cones are said to be “space-like”. Events that are connected by space-like intervals cannot be causally related (one cannot cause the other). Observers in different frames of reference will disagree on the time ordering of space-like events. For example, when Alice observed the two clocks on the platform to emit pulses of light at the same time, Brice disagreed; those two events are connected by a space-like interval.\n\nFinally, the space-time interval between events that are on each other’s light-cone (connected by a line that makes a 45 {\\rm \\degree} angle with the x-axis), is said to be “light-like” or “null”.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#space-time-diagrams","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Lorentz transformations","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/specialrelativity#lorentz-transformations","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Lorentz transformations","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"content":"In this section, we consider how to transform the space-time coordinates, (x,y,z,ct), as measured in a frame of reference, S, to coordinate (x',y',z',c't), as measured in a frame of reference, S', that is moving with a constant speed, v, relative to the frame, S. For simplicity, we assume that frame S' is moving with speed v in the positive x direction, as measured in frame, S, and that the origin of the two coordinate systems coincided at time t=0. \n\nFigure 17 shows an illustration of how the two frames of reference are related (note that these are actual coordinate systems, not space-time diagrams).\n\n\n\nFigure 17:The reference frame S' is moving relative to reference frame, S, with speed v in the x direction. At time t=0, the origins of the two coordinate systems coincided.\n\nIf we ignore any of Special Relativity, then the coordinates in S' are easily related to those in the S frame of reference using the “Galilean transformations”:x' &= x - vt\\\\\ny' &= y\\\\\nz' &= z\\\\\nt' &= t\n\nand this corresponds to transformations that we have implicitly used before considering Special Relativity. These equations also allow us to relate the speeds measured in different frames of reference. Suppose that an object has a velocity, \\vec u=(u_x,u_y,u_z), as measured in the frame of reference, S. We can obtain the components of the velocity vector, \\vec u', as measured in the frame of reference, S', by taking the time derivatives of the above equations:u'_x &= \\frac{dx'}{dt'}=\\frac{dx'}{dt}=\\frac{d}{dt}(x-vt)=\\frac{dx}{dt}-v=u_x - v\\\\\nu'_y &=\\frac{dy'}{dt'}=u_y\\\\\nu'_z &=\\frac{dz'}{dt'}=u_z\n\nwhich is trivial, since t=t'. The transformations above are equivalent (identical) to the rules for transforming velocity that we derived in \n\nSection  %s for kinematics. In Galilean relativity, time is an absolute quantity that does not depend on the frame of reference. In Special Relativity, the time coordinate depends on the frame of reference, so we cannot simply convert a time derivative in t' to a derivative in t. Instead, we must use the Lorentz transformations.\n\nWe can use the formulas for length contraction and time dilation to derive the Lorentz transformations. Referring to \n\nFigure 17, x refers to the distance between a point in space-time and the origin of the x axis in frame S, as measured in frame S. Similarly, x', is the distance to the point in space-time as measured in frame S', from the origin of S'. In frame  S, the distance x' will be contracted to the length x'/\\gamma, so that the Galilean transformation for the x coordinate is modified as follows:x' &= x - vt\\quad\\text{(Galilean)}\\\\\n\\frac{x'}{\\gamma} &= x - vt\\\\\n\\therefore x'&=\\gamma (x-vt)\\quad\\text{(Lorentz)}\n\nThe y and z coordinates are the same between frames of references, since all of the length contraction will take place in the direction of the relative motion between frames of reference, which we chose to be in the x direction.\n\nWe can obtain the equation for the time coordinate by considering that, in the S' frame of reference, it is the x coordinate that is contracted to x/\\gamma. In the S' frame of reference, the distance between the origins of the two systems is vt' (note the prime on t). We can thus write the contracted distance x, in the S' frame of reference:\\frac{x}{\\gamma}&=vt'+x'\\\\\nt'&= \\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\gamma}-x'\\right)\n\nWe can eliminate x' from the last equation using the Lorentz transformation for x' that we just found:t'&= \\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\gamma}-x'\\right)\\\\\nt'&= \\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\gamma}-\\gamma x+\\gamma vt\\right)\\\\\n\\frac{t'}{\\gamma}&=\\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\gamma^2}-x+vt\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{v}\\left(x\\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)-x+vt\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{v}\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}x+vt\\right)\\\\\n&=t-\\frac{vx}{c^2}\\\\\n\\therefore t'&=\\gamma\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2} \\right)\n\nwhere we wrote out the γ factor out explicitly in the fourth line. We can summarize the Lorentz transformations as follows:x' &=\\gamma (x-vt)\\\\\ny' &= y\\\\\nz' &= z\\\\\nt' &=\\gamma\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2} \\right)\n\nand the inverse relations are easily found:x &=\\gamma (x'+vt')\\\\\ny &= y'\\\\\nz &= z'\\\\\nt &=\\gamma\\left(t'+\\frac{vx'}{c^2} \\right)\n\nNote that the Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations when the speed, v, between frames of reference is small (so that \\gamma \\sim 1).\n\nExample 23.4\n\nIn a frame, S, a pulse of light is emitted (at the speed of light) in the positive x direction at t=0 from the origin. The pulse is then absorbed at time t at position x=d. Use the Lorentz transformation to show that, in a frame, S', moving in the positive x direction with speed v, relative to S, the pulse also travelled at the speed of light.\n\nSolution\n\nIn order to use the Lorentz transformations, we need to define “events”, with coordinates in space-time, that we can then convert from one frame of reference to another. Let A be the event that corresponds to the emission of the pulse of light, and B the event that corresponds to the absorption of the pulse. In frame, S, the coordinates of these events are:x_A&=0\\\\\nt_A&=0\\\\\nx_B&=d\\\\\nt_B&=\\frac{d}{c}\n\nwhere in the last line, we used the fact that, in frame, S, the pulse travels at the speed of light. Applying the Lorentz transformations, we can find the coordinates of the same events in frame S':x'_A&=\\gamma (x_A-vt_A)=0\\\\\nt'_A&=\\gamma\\left(t_A-\\frac{vx_A}{c^2} \\right)=0\\\\\nx'_B&=\\gamma (x_B-vt_B)=\\gamma \\left(d-v\\frac{d}{c}\\right)\\\\\nt'_B&=\\gamma\\left(t_B-\\frac{vx_B}{c^2} \\right)=\\gamma\\left(\\frac{d}{c}-\\frac{vd}{c^2} \\right)\n\nThe speed, v'_p, of the pulse of light in frame S' is given by:v'_p&=\\frac{(x'_B-x'_A)}{(t'_B-t'_A)}=\\frac{\\gamma \\left(d-v\\frac{d}{c}\\right)}{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{d}{c}-\\frac{vd}{c^2} \\right)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\left(d-v\\frac{d}{c}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{d}{c}-\\frac{vd}{c^2} \\right)}=c\\frac{\\left(\\frac{d}{c}-v\\frac{d}{c^2}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{d}{c}-\\frac{vd}{c^2} \\right)}=c\n\nwhich is the speed of light, as expected.\n\nDiscussion: In this example, we showed how to use the Lorentz transformations by clearly defining “events” and their coordinates in space-time. We saw that the Lorentz transformations are consistent with Einstein’s second postulate and that the speed of light is the same all frames of reference. This of course makes sense, as we derived the Lorentz transformations from time dilation and length contraction, which are consequences of the postulate.\n\nEinstein’s second postulate states that the speed of light is independent of the frame of reference. Consider two points in space-time corresponding to the emission (A) and the absorption (B) of a pulse of light. In the reference frame, S, the distance squared in space between these two events must be equal to the distance (squared) that light travelled between the time of emission and absorption:(x_B-x_A)^2+(y_B-y_A)^2+(z_B-z_A)^2&= c^2(t_B-t_A)^2\\\\\n\\therefore \\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 +\\Delta z^2&=c^2\\Delta t^2\n\nwhere (x_A,y_A,z_A,ct_A) and (x_B,y_B,z_B,ct_B) are the space-time coordinates of events A and B. The above equation must hold in all frame of references (e.g. adding a prime to each coordinate), since it is a statement that the speed of light is c.\n\nWe can define s as the “space-time interval” between events A and B:s^2 = \\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 +\\Delta z^2&-c^2\\Delta t^2\n\nwhich turns out to be “Lorentz invariant” (meaning that this value is the same in all reference frames). The space-time interval can be thought of as a “distance” in space-time that is the same in all reference frames. If the events A and B corresponds to the emission and absorption of light, then s=0, and we say that the interval between A and B is light-like or null. If s<0, the events are on a time-like interval, and if s>0, the events are separated by a space-like interval. Since s does not depend on the frame of reference, all observers will agree on whether events are separated by time or space-like intervals.\n\nWe can visualize the effect of Lorentz transformations on space-time diagrams, as in \n\nFigure 18, which shows the space-time diagrams for a reference frame, S, and a second reference frame, S', moving with speed v in the x direction relative to S.\n\n\n\nFigure 18:The reference frame S' is moving relative to reference frame, S, with speed v in the x direction. We can illustrate this on a space-time diagram by tilting the axes of the S' coordinate system by an angle \\tan\\alpha=v/c, as shown.\n\nThe effect of the Lorentz transformation on a space-time diagram is to tilt both the space and time axes “inwards”, by an angle, α, given by:\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{v}{c}\n\nFigure 18 shows a light-like interval between two points, A and B, and how to determine the space-time coordinates in the two reference frames. You can think of space-time as the sheet of paper on which events happen. You can then draw different coordinate systems on that piece of paper to describe the position (in space and time) of different events.\n\nExample 23.5\n\nUse a space-time diagram to show how two events at different locations that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are not simultaneous in a reference frame that is moving relative to the one where the events are simultaneous. This is an illustration of the relativity of simultaneity that we uncovered at the beginning of the chapter when examining Alice on a train platform and the two pulses of light.\n\nSolution\n\nLet S be the frame of reference where two events, A and B, are simultaneous. These events are connected by a space-like interval, since they are separated in space, but not in time. There is no way for one event to have caused the other. In frame S, these events are on a horizontal line in a space-time diagram.\n\nLet us define a second reference frame, S', that is moving with speed v, relative to S. We have illustrated space-time diagrams for the the two reference frames and the events A and B in \n\nFigure 19.\n\n\n\nFigure 19:In the frame of reference S, the events A and B occur at the same time. In frame, S', event B occurs before event A (since t_B < t_A). The two events are space-like, so observers in different frames of reference cannot agree on which happened first.\n\nFrom the space-time diagram, it is clear that, in frame S', event B happened first. If frame S' was moving in the opposite (negative x) direction, event A would occur first, and the axes of S' would be tilted in the other direction (so that the opening angle between the axes is greater than 90 {\\rm \\degree}).\n\nDiscussion: This example illustrates how space-time diagrams can be used to qualitatively model events in space-time between two different reference frames. In particular, we showed how two events that are simultaneous in one frame (S) are not simultaneous in a different frame. For events connected by space-like intervals, there exist frames of reference where the events are simultaneous, or where either one happened first. If two events are separated by a time-like interval, there is no frame of reference in which one will disagree in the ordering of the events (although observers in different frames of reference will still measure different lengths of time between events due to time-dilation). For time-like events, the moving frame of reference would have to go faster than the speed of light for the time ordering to be different. This would violate causality, and is a good argument as to why nothing can go faster than the speed of light!\n\nOlivia’s Thoughts\n\nNow that we know how to visualize Lorentz transformations on space time diagrams, we can better understand space-like and time-like events. In the left panel of \n\nFigure 20, I have shown an event A and its light cone. Events A and B are space-like, because they are separated more in space than in time (we can see this from the slope: the rise is less than the run). Conversely, events A and C are time-like because they are separated more in time than space. None of these three events occur at the same time or place in this reference frame.\n\n\n\nFigure 20:Left: Three events, A, B, and C, that are separated in space and time. We can determine if the intervals between them are space-like or time-like by looking at the slope and comparing the rise and the run. Right: In a new reference frame, events A and B occur at the same time and events A and C occur at the same place.\n\nIn the right panel of \n\nFigure 20, I have introduced a new reference frame. You can see that in the new reference frame, events A and B occur at the same time (they are connected by a line that is parallel to the x' axis), and events A and C occur at the same position. In this example, I have shown that if the interval between two events is space-like (e.g. for A and B), there is a reference frame in which they occur at the same time. Similarly, if the interval is time-like (e.g. for A and C), there is a reference frame in which they occur at the same place.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#lorentz-transformations","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Lorentz addition of velocities","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/specialrelativity#lorentz-addition-of-velocities","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl3":"Lorentz addition of velocities","lvl2":"Lorentz transformations and space-time"},"content":"In the previous section, we reviewed the Galilean velocity transformations that allow us to convert a velocity, \\vec u, as measured in one frame of reference, to a velocity, \\vec u', measured in a different frame of reference.

We can proceed in a similar way to determine the y and z components. Note that, unlike the Galilean case, all of the velocity components must transform, since the time derivative is involved for each component. Intuitively, we expect all components of velocity to be affected, since one needs to guarantee that the total speed is always below c. The velocity transformations for all components are given by the following:u'_x&=\\frac{u_x -v}{1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}}\\\\\nu'_y &=\\frac{u_y}{\\gamma\\left(1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\\\\\nu'_z &=\\frac{u_z}{\\gamma\\left(1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\n\nand the reverse transformations are given by:u_x &=\\frac{u'_x +v}{1+ \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}}\\\\\nu_y &=\\frac{u'_y}{\\gamma\\left(1+ \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\\\\\nu_z &=\\frac{u'_z}{\\gamma\\left(1+ \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\n\nExample 23.6\n\nAn archer can shoot a very fast arrow with a speed of 0.5c.

The speed of the arrow, as seen from the train (S'), is given by:u'_x = 0.5c\n\nThe speed of the arrow, as measured from the ground, is thus given by:u_x &=\\frac{u'_x +v}{1+ \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(0.5c) +(0.7c)}{1+ \\frac{(0.7c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}\\\\`\n&=\\frac{(1.2c)}{1+(0.7)(0.5)}=\\frac{1.2}{1.35}c=0.89c\n\nDiscussion: By using the Lorentz transformations for velocity, we see that the arrow does not exceed the speed of light. Had we used Galilean relativity, we would have concluded that the arrow has a speed of 1.2c when measured from the ground.\n\nJosh’s Thoughts\n\nThis chapter is where the bubble of intuitive reality is popped, and students (like you and me) are given the opportunity to challenge our understanding of how the universe operates. As amazing and exciting as this is, it can also be incredibly frustrating. Many students rely on intuition to guide them as they problem solve, but hit a wall in special relativity. To avoid this issue, I suggest drawing spacetime diagrams and using Lorentz transformations. Practicing with these tools will help make the process of understanding the strange consequences of Einstein’s postulates less awkward.\n\nIn addition to the practical advice I have given, I recommend embracing the strangeness of reality. Throughout history, scientists have ventured into the unknown in attempts to discover and decode the universe. In many cases, the answer to a question has posed more questions than answers, and humanity is given the opportunity to further understand the world we live in. As a student, you are participating in a process of understanding which allows us to continue the adventure that is scientific inquiry. Confusion can be frustrating, but don’t let it discourage you, being confused means that you’re only a few steps away from understanding!","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#lorentz-addition-of-velocities","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Relativistic momentum and energy"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#relativistic-momentum-and-energy","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Relativistic momentum and energy"},"content":"In this section, we show how to define momentum and energy in a way that is consistent with the postulates of Special Relativity. We expect that, since time and space depend on the frame of reference of the observer, so too will the momentum and the energy of an object. Consider an object of mass m_0, moving in frame of reference S, with velocity \\vec u (we reserve \\vec v to represent the speed between two inertial frames of reference) in the x direction. At some time, t, the object will be at position x along the x axis. We define the relativistic momentum as:p = m_0\\frac{dx}{dt'}\n\nwhere t' is the time as measured in the rest frame of the object. By defining momentum in terms of the proper time of the object, all observers will agree on the value of t'. In the frame of reference, S, (with time t) this corresponds to:p = m_0\\frac{dx}{dt'}=m_0\\frac{dt}{dt'}\\frac{dx}{dt}=m_0\\frac{dt}{dt'}u\n\nwhere u is the speed of the particle in frame, S. We can use time dilation to re-express the derivative:\\Delta t &= \\gamma \\Delta t'\\\\\n\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta t'}&=\\gamma\\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{dt}{dt'}&=\\gamma\n\nwhere in the last line, we simply took the limit of an infinitesimally short time interval. Therefore, the relativistic momentum of the particle in frame S can be defined as\\boxed{\\vec p = m_0\\gamma\\vec u =  \\frac{m_0\\vec u}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}}} }\n\nwhere γ is calculated with the same speed, u, since that is the speed of the reference frame of the object relative to S. Note that as the speed, u, of the particle approaches the speed of light, the factor of γ approaches infinity. This means that an object with a mass can never reach the speed of light, as it would have an infinite momentum. In order to define momentum in a way that resembles the classic definition, one can think of the mass of the object as depending on the speed of the object. We define the rest-mass, m_0, of the object as the mass that is measured when the object is at rest. We can then model the mass of the object as increasing with its speed:m(u) = \\gamma m_0 = \\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}}}\n\nso that the relativistic momentum would be defined as:\\vec p = m(u)\\vec u\n\nIn this case, we can think of the mass of the object as increasing with its speed. The object would acquire infinite mass if it were to reach the speed of light.\n\nWith the relativistic definition of momentum, Newton’s Second Law can be written as:\\vec F = \\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}=\\frac{d}{dt}m_0\\gamma\\vec u\n\nExample 23.7\n\nA constant force of 1\\times 10^{-22} {\\rm N} is applied to an electron (with mass m_e=9.11\\times 10^{-31} {\\rm kg}) in order to accelerate it from rest to a speed of u=0.99c. Compare the length of time over which the force must be applied using classical and relativistic dynamics.\n\nSolution\n\nIn both cases, we can start with Newton’s Second Law:\\vec F &= \\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}\\\\\n\\therefore \\int \\vec F dt &= \\Delta \\vec p = \\vec p\n\nwhere \\vec p is the final momentum of the electron (which is different depending on whether we use the classical or the relativistic definition of momentum). Since the force is constant:\\int \\vec F dt&=\\vec F \\Delta t=\\vec p\\\\\n\\therefore \\Delta t &=\\frac{p}{F}\n\nwhere \\Delta t is the length of time over which the force is applied. With the classical definition of momentum, the time is given by: \\Delta t &=\\frac{p}{F} = \\frac{mu}{F}=\\frac{(9.11\\times 10^{-31} {\\rm kg})(0.99)(3\\times 10^{8} {\\rm m/s})}{(1\\times 10^{-22} {\\rm N})}=2.71 {\\rm s}\n\nWith the relativistic definition of momentum, we first need the gamma factor:\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(0.99)^2}}=7.1\n\nWe can then calculate the time over which the force needs to be applied:\\Delta t &=\\frac{p}{F} = \\frac{\\gamma m_0u}{F}=\\gamma  \\frac{m_0u}{F}=(7.1)(2.71 {\\rm s})=19.2 {\\rm s}\n\nDiscussion: When using the relativistic definition of momentum, we find that the time over which the force must be applied to reach a given speed is longer. This makes sense, since it will take infinitely long to reach the speed of light. Also, note that the time that is required using relativistic dynamics is just the time-dilated time that is required in classical dynamics.\n\nRecall that we defined kinetic energy in \n\nSection 7.3 by defining the change in kinetic energy of an object as the net work done on that object. We use the same formalism here to redefine kinetic energy using relativistic dynamics.\n\nThe work done by the net force, \\vec F, on an object that goes from position A to position B is given byW = \\int_A^B \\vec F\\cdot d\\vec l=\\int_0^t \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}m_0\\gamma\\vec u \\right)\\cdot(\\vec u dt)\n\nwhere we recognized that an infinitesimal segment, d\\vec l, along the path of the object is given by d\\vec l=\\vec u dt. The time infinitesimals, dt, cancel, and we are left with:W&=\\int_0^t \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}m_0\\gamma\\vec u \\right)\\cdot(\\vec u dt)\\\\\n&=\\int d(m_0\\gamma \\vec u)\\cdot \\vec u\n\nwhich we can integrate by parts. We can integrate this over the speed, u, and we assume that the object started with a speed of u=0 at the beginning of the path and has a speed, u=U, at the end of the path:W&=\\int_0^U d(m_0\\gamma \\vec u)\\cdot \\vec u = \\Big[\\gamma m_0 \\vec u\\cdot\\vec u\\Big]_0^U-\\int_0^U m_0\\gamma u du\\quad\\text{(int. by parts)}\\\\\n&=\\gamma m_0 U^2-m_0\\int_0^U\\frac{udu}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}}}\\\\\n&=\\gamma m_0 U^2-m_0\\Big[ c^2\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}} \\Big]_0^U\\\\\n&=\\gamma m_0 U^2-m_0c^2+m_0c^2\\sqrt{1-\\frac{U^2}{c^2}}\\\\\n&=\\gamma \\left(m_0 U^2+m_0c^2\\left(1-\\frac{U^2}{c^2}\\right)\\right)-m_0c^2\\\\\n&=m_0c^2(\\gamma -1)\n\nSince the object started at rest (with a speed u=0) the above integral corresponds to what we would call the kinetic energy of the object, with speed u:K=m_0c^2(\\gamma -1)=m_0c^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}}}-1\\right)\n\nThis form for the relativistic kinetic energy of the object is not at all similar to the form that we obtained in classical physics. As the speed of the object approaches the speed of light, the γ factor approaches infinity, as does the kinetic energy. Thus, it would take an infinite amount of work to accelerate an object to the speed of light, and again, we see that it is impossible for anything with mass to ever reach the speed of light. The formula above, however, should always be correct, even in the non-relativistic limit, when v<<c. We can approximate the gamma factor using the binomial expansion for the case where x<<1:(1+x)^n\\sim 1 + nx +\\dots\n\nSo that, when v<<c (and v^2/c^2<<1), the gamma factor is approximated by:\\gamma=\\left(1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\sim 1+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{u^2}{c^2}\n\nIn this limit, the relativistic kinetic energy reduces to:\\lim_{v<<c}K=\\lim_{v<<c}m_0c^2(\\gamma -1)\\sim m_0c^2\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{u^2}{c^2} - 1  \\right)=\\frac{1}{2}mu^2\n\nwhich is the classical definition of kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is also zero when the speed is zero.\n\nThe kinetic energy has two terms in it:K=m_0c^2\\gamma -m_0c^2\n\nThe first term increases with speed and behaves as we would expect. The second term is constant, and depends only on the rest mass of the object (we call this term the rest mass energy). We can think of this in slightly different terms. Let us define the total energy, E, of the object as:E=m_0c^2\\gamma\\\\\n\\therefore \\;\\boxed{E = K+m_0c^2}\n\nso that the total energy is just the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. This highlights a key aspect of Special Relativity. An object will have energy, E, even when it is at rest. That energy, at rest, is called the rest mass energy, and corresponds to energy that an object has by virtue of having mass. This is, of course, Einstein’s famous equation:\\boxed{E=m_0c^2}\\quad \\text{(rest mass energy)}\n\nThis equation implies that mass can be thought of as a form of energy. Nuclear reactors function by converting a small amount of mass of uranium atoms into energy (in the form of heat), that is then used to produce high pressure steam to rotate a turbine.\n\nEinstein’s relation is often used to express the mass of subatomic particles in terms of energy. For example, an electron has a mass of 511e3 {\\rm eV/c^2} in these units.\n\nExample 23.8\n\nWhat is the mass of a proton, m_p=1.67\\times 10^{-27} {\\rm kg}, in units of {\\rm MeV/c^2} (where the M stands for “Mega”, and corresponds to 1 {\\rm MeV}=1\\times 10^{6} {\\rm eV})?\n\nSolution\n\nWe can first calculate the rest mass energy of the proton in Joules:E=m_pc^2=(1.67\\times 10^{-27} {\\rm kg})(3\\times 10^{8} {\\rm m/s})^2=1.503\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm J}\n\nWe can then convert from Joules to electron-volts:\\frac{(1.503\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm J})}{(1.6\\times 10^{-19} {\\rm J/eV})}=939.4\\times 10^{6} {\\rm eV}=939.4 {\\rm MeV}\n\nThe mass of the proton can then be expressed as m_p=939.4 {\\rm MeV/c^2}.\n\nFinally, it is interesting to examine the relationship between the momentum and the energy of a relativistic object. Consider the quantity c^2p^2:c^2p^2 &= c^2(\\gamma m_0 u)^2\\\\\n&=c^2\\gamma^2m_0^2u^2\\\\\n&=c^4\\gamma^2m_0^2\\frac{u^2}{c^2}\\\\\n&=c^4\\gamma^2m_0^2\\left(1- \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}\\right)\\\\\n&=c^4\\gamma^2m_0^2 - c^4m_0^2\\\\\n&=E^2-c^4m_0^2\n\nwhere we recognized that c^4\\gamma^2m_0^2 is simply the energy, E, squared. This is generally called the “energy-momentum” relation and written:\\boxed{E^2=p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4}\n\nAn interesting consequence of this relationship is that particles with no mass will still have a momentum. For example, the photon, which is a particle of light and must thus have a mass of zero (or it could not move at the speed of light), will have a momentum given by:p=\\frac{E}{c}\n\nThus, one can use light to impart momentum to something. This is how a solar sail, a proposed propulsion mechanism for space travel, operates.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#relativistic-momentum-and-energy","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Closing remarks"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#closing-remarks","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Closing remarks"},"content":"In this chapter, we introduced the first hints of how the laws of physics become counter-intuitive and quite bizarre. One can wrap one’s head around Newton’s Second Law, \\vec F^{net}=m\\vec a, and develop some intuition as to how an object may behave. However, it is difficult to imagine how people age slower if they travel faster, and how cars become shorter when they are moving. However, as far as we can tell, this is the best way to describe the Universe around us.\n\nThis all goes back to our original statements about physics. The goal is to come up with rules that allow us to describe Nature. It’s nice when those rules make sense, but, unfortunately, that is not a requirement. It does appear that the rules that describe Nature do not make sense, at least not based on our common experience, living in a macroscopic world where speeds are much less than the speed of light. With Special Relativity, we introduced the modern framework for modelling dynamics. We have not introduced Quantum Mechanics, which describes how elementary particles behave.\n\nQuantum Mechanics is even less intuitive than Special Relativity, as it implies that particles act as if they are in multiple places at the same time. Even worse, Quantum Mechanics requires us to abandon the concept of determinism that is critical in Classical Mechanics; in Quantum Mechanics, we can only ever determine probabilities. For example, we can only determine the probability that a particle will be at a particular location at a particular time, but we cannot use kinematics and dynamics to predict where it will be at some time based on the forces acting upon it.\n\nIf you decide to pursue further studies in physics, you will get to learn more about these theories, which are quite marvellous. It should not bother you that physics is not intuitive, as that is not the purpose. The exciting part of physics is that, even if Nature behaves in an exquisitely weird way, it does appear that this can all be described with a rather limited set of mathematical equations. One can argue that there is beauty in the fact that succinct mathematics can describe a large number of seemingly unrelated phenomena, as Newton’s Universal Theory of Gravity was able to describe both the motion of a falling apple and the orbit of the moon.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#closing-remarks","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/specialrelativity#summary","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 23 - The Theory of Special Relativity","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"The Theory of Special Relativity is based on Einstein’s two postulates:\n\nThe laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. There is no experiment that can be performed to determine whether one is at rest or moving with constant velocity.\n\nThe speed of light propagating in vacuum is the same in all inertial reference frames. Any observer in an inertial frame of reference, regardless of their velocity, will measure that light has a speed of c, when it propagates in vacuum.\n\nThese postulates are required in order for the equations from electromagnetism to be valid in all inertial frames of reference. However, they lead to very counter-intuitive results. For example, if two events, A and B, are simultaneous in one frame of reference, an observer in a different frame of reference will observe event A to happen earlier/later than event B (earlier or later will depend on the direction of motion of the moving observer).\n\nThe Theory of Special Relativity allows us to relate observations made in one inertial frame of reference, S, to observations made in a different inertial frame of reference, S', that is moving with constant velocity, \\vec v, relative to S. We always choose to define the x axis in the S and S' frames of reference so that they are both co-linear with the velocity of S', \\vec v, which is defined to be in the positive x direction in frame, S. Furthermore, we assume that the origin of both frames of reference coincided at time t=0.\n\nWe define the gamma factor, γ, based on the speed, v, of S' relative to S:\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\nThe gamma factor is always greater or equal to 1. If a time interval, \\Delta t, is measured in frame, S, then a “dilated” time interval, \\Delta t', will be measured in frame S':\\Delta t'=\\gamma \\Delta t\n\nsince \\gamma \\geq 1. We call the time that is measured in a frame of reference that we consider “at rest” to be the “proper time” in that frame of reference. For example, a muon decays in 2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} when at rest. If a muon moves at high speed, in the frame of reference where the muon is moving, it will take longer (time dilation), for the muon to decay. The time 2.2 {\\rm \\mu s} is the “proper time” for the muon decay (since it is measured when the muon is at rest). As a consequence of time dilation, observers in different frames of reference will measure different lengths due to “length contraction”. If an object has a “proper length”, L, in a frame of reference, S, that is at rest relative to the object, the object will have a contracted length, L', in a reference frame, S', moving with speed, v, relative to S:L'&=\\frac{L}{\\gamma}\n\nNote that only the dimension of the object that is co-linear with the velocity vector, \\vec v, is contracted.\n\nWe also noted that Special Relativity is intimately connected to electromagnetism. In particular, we described how what we model as a magnetic force in one frame of reference might be modelled as an electric force in a different frame of reference.\n\nIn order to describe the motion of objects, we found that we need to define a four-dimensional space-time, where positions in space-time are labelled by 4 “coordinates”, (x,y,z,ct), instead of the usual 3 (space) position coordinates. This is a result of the fact that time is no longer absolute and depends on the frame of reference (e.g. time dilation).\n\nIn space-time, we think in terms of events that occur at specific locations in space and instants in time. We can visualise space-time using “space-time diagrams”, where one axis corresponds to space (x), and the other axis corresponds to time (ct). The path of an object through space-time is called its “world line”.\n\nFor a given event in space-time, we can define past and future “light cones”. Only events in the past light-cone could have had a causal effect on the event. Similarly, only events in the future light-cone can ever be influenced by that event. Events that can be causally connected (within each other’s light cones) are said to be “time-like”. Events that are outside of each other’s light cones are said to be “space-like”. If two events are time-like, all observers will agree on the order in which the events happened, preserving the notion of causality. Different observers can disagree on the order in which space-like events occurred.\n\nThe Lorentz transformations allow us to convert the coordinates of events in one frame of reference, S, to those in a frames, S', moving with constant speed, v, relative to S:x' &=\\gamma (x-vt)\\\\\ny' &= y\\\\\nz' &= z\\\\\nt' &=\\gamma\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2} \\right)\n\nand the inverse relations are easily found:x &=\\gamma (x'+vt')\\\\\ny &= y'\\\\\nz &= z'\\\\\nt &=\\gamma\\left(t'+\\frac{vx'}{c^2} \\right)\n\nCertain quantities, which are measured to be the same in all frames of reference, are said to be “Lorentz invariant”. In particular, we can define the space-time interval, s, between two events in space-time as:s^2 = \\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 +\\Delta z^2&-c^2\\Delta t^2\n\nOne can think of this as a sort of “distance” in space-time, that does not depend on the frame of reference.\n\nIf an object has a velocity vector, \\vec u, as measured in frame of reference S, then its velocity, \\vec u', in a frame, S', moving with speed, v, relative to S, is given by:u'_x&=\\frac{u_x -v}{1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}}\\\\\nu'_y &=\\frac{u_y}{\\gamma\\left(1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\\\\\nu'_z &=\\frac{u_z}{\\gamma\\left(1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\n\nand the reverse transformations are given by:u_x &=\\frac{u'_x +v}{1+ \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}}\\\\\nu_y &=\\frac{u'_y}{\\gamma\\left(1+ \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\\\\\nu_z &=\\frac{u'_z}{\\gamma\\left(1+ \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\n\nIn order for momentum and energy to be conserved in Special Relativity, these need to be redefined. If a particles with rest mass, m_0, has a velocity, \\vec u, in an inertial frame of reference, its relativistic momentum, \\vec p, is defined to be:\\vec p = \\gamma m_0 \\vec u\n\nwhere the gamma factor is evaluated using the speed, u:\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}}}\n\nThis relativistic definition of momentum is equivalent to the classical definition when u<<c. We can think of relativistic momentum in the same way as classical momentum, if we model the mass of the object as increasing with its speed:m(u)&=\\gamma m_0\\\\\n\\therefore \\vec p &= m(u) \\vec u\n\nwhere m_0 is the mass of the object measured when the object is at rest (its “rest mass”). An object with a rest mass can never reach the speed of light, as this would correspond to it having infinite momentum (or infinite mass).\n\nWith the relativistic definition of momentum, one can still use Newton’s Second Law in the form:\\vec F = \\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}\n\nWe define the total energy, E, of an object as:E = K + m_0c^2\n\nwhich  has a contribution from its kinetic energy, K, and from its mass (the second term).  The energy that an object has by virtue of having a mass is called “rest mass energy”, which implies that mass and energy can really be thought of as the same thing; one can convert mass into energy and vice versa (as in a nuclear reactor).\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object moving with speed, u, is given by:K = m_0c^2 (\\gamma -1)\n\nwhere the gamma factor is obtained using the speed, u. This relativistic definition of kinetic energy is equivalent to the classical definition when u<<c. The total energy of a particle can also be written as:E=\\gamma m_0 c^2\n\nSince energy and mass are simply related by a constant, one can use units of energy to describe the mass of a particle. It is common in particle physics to express the mass of particles in units of {\\rm MeV/c^2}.\n\nFinally, we saw that the relativistic momentum and energy of an object are related:E^2 = p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4\n\nIn particular, particles of light, which have no mass but have kinetic energy, have non-zero momentum:p=\\frac{E}{c}\n\nImportant Equations\n\nLorentz factor:\\gamma &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\nTime dilation\\Delta t'=\\gamma \\Delta t\n\nLength contractionL'=\\frac{L}{\\gamma}\n\nLorentz transformations:x' &=\\gamma (x-vt)\\\\\ny' &= y\\\\\nz' &= z\\\\\nt' &=\\gamma\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^2} \\right)\n\nVelocity addition:u'_x&=\\frac{u_x -v}{1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}}\\\\\nu'_y &=\\frac{u_y}{\\gamma\\left(1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\\\\\nu'_z &=\\frac{u_z}{\\gamma\\left(1- \\frac{vu_x}{c^2}\\right)}\n\nThe spacetime interval:s^2 = \\Delta x^2+\\Delta y^2+\\Delta z^2-c^2\\Delta t^t\n\nRelativistic momentum:\\vec p = \\gamma m_0 \\vec u\n\nRelativistic energy:E = \\gamma m_0 c^2 = K + m_0c^2\n\nRelativistic kinetic energy:K=(\\gamma -1) m_0c^2\n\nNewton’s Second Law\\vec F = \\frac{d\\vec p }{dt}\n\nEnergy-momentum relation:E^2 = p^2c^2 +m_0^2c^4\n\nImportant Definitions\n\nProper time: The time measured in a frame of reference considered at rest.

In order to find out how far the proton travels in the lab when one second of proper time goes by in the proton’s frame of reference, we need to determine how much time went by in the lab’s frame of reference.\n\nThe gamma factor for the proton can be obtained from the speed that we determined in part a), or from the total energy directly:\\gamma &= \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(2.5\\times 10^{3} {\\rm MeV})}{(938.3 {\\rm MeV/c^2})c^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(2.5\\times 10^{3} {\\rm MeV})}{(938.3 {\\rm MeV})}\\\\\n&=2.66\n\nThus, when \\Delta t=1 {\\rm s} elapses in the proton’s frame of reference, a time dilated time, \\Delta t', elapses in the lab frame of reference:\\Delta t' = \\gamma \\Delta t = 2.66 {\\rm s}\n\nIn the lab frame, the proton will travel a distance:d &= vt\\\\\n&= (2.78\\times 10^{8} {\\rm m/s})(2.66 {\\rm s})\\\\\n&=7.39\\times 10^{8} {\\rm m}\n\nThis statement is generally true for Special Relativity, because the force is exerted in the direction perpendicular to that of motion.\n\nOutwards if the speed of S' is in the negative x direction relative to S.\n\nIn reality, there are many more reactions involved in getting from hydrogen to helium.","type":"content","url":"/specialrelativity#solutions","position":39},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/calculus","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/calculus","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/calculus#app-calculus","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"This appendix gives a very brief introduction to calculus with a focus on the tools needed in physics.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand how to determine a derivative and that it measures a rate of change.\n\nUnderstand how to determine partial derivatives and gradients.\n\nUnderstand how to determine anti-derivatives and that integrals are sums.","type":"content","url":"/calculus#app-calculus","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl2":"Functions of real numbers"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/calculus#functions-of-real-numbers","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl2":"Functions of real numbers"},"content":"In calculus, we work with functions and their properties, rather than with variables as we do in algebra. We are usually concerned with describing functions in terms of their slope, the area (or volumes) that they enclose, their curvature, their roots (when they have a value of zero) and their continuity. The functions that we will examine are a mapping from one or more independent real numbers to one real number. By convention, we will use x,y,z to indicate independent variables, and f() and g(), to denote functions. For example, if we say:f(x) &= x^2\\\\\n\\therefore f(2) &= 4\n\nwe mean that f(x) is a function that can be evaluated for any real number, x, and the result of evaluating the function is to square the number x.

For any value of x, we can define the slope of the function as the “steepness of the curve”. For values of x>0 the function increases as x increases, so we say that the slope is positive. For values of x<0, the function decreases as x increases, so we say that the slope is negative. A synonym for the word slope is “derivative”, which is the word that we prefer to use in calculus. The derivative of a function f(x) is given the symbol \\frac{df}{dx} to indicate that we are referring to the slope of f(x) when plotted as a function of x.\n\nWe need to specify which variable we are taking the derivative with respect to when the function has more than one variable but only one of them should be considered independent. For example, the function f(x)=ax^2+b will have different values if a and b are changed, so we have to be precise in specifying that we are taking the derivative with respect to x. The following notations are equivalent ways to say that we are taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\\frac{df}{dx}=\\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = f'(x) = f'\n\nThe notation with the prime (f'(x),f') can be useful to indicate that the derivative itself is also a function of x.\n\nThe slope (derivative) of a function tells us how rapidly the value of the function is changing when the independent variable is changing. For f(x)=x^2, as x gets more and more positive, the function gets steeper and steeper; the derivative is thus increasing with x. The sign of the derivative tells us if the function is increasing or decreasing, whereas its absolute value tells how quickly the function is changing (how steep it is).\n\nWe can approximate the derivative by evaluating how much f(x) changes when x changes by a small amount, say, \\Delta x. In the limit of \\Delta x\\to 0, we get the derivative. In fact, this is the formal definition of the derivative:\\boxed{\\frac{df}{dx}=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x} =\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x} }\n\nwhere \\Delta f is the small change in f(x) that corresponds to the small change, \\Delta x, in x. This makes the notation for the derivative more clear, dx is \\Delta x in the limit where \\Delta x\\to0, and df is \\Delta f, in the same limit of \\Delta x\\to 0.\n\nAs an example, let us determine the function f'(x) that is the derivative of f(x)=x^2. We start by calculating \\Delta f:\\Delta f &= f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\\\\n&=(x+\\Delta x)^2 - x^2\\\\\n&=x^2+2x\\Delta x+\\Delta x^2 -x^2\\\\\n&=2x\\Delta x+\\Delta x^2\n\nWe now calculate \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x}:\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x}&=\\frac{2x\\Delta x+\\Delta x^2}{\\Delta x}\\\\\n&=2x+\\Delta x\n\nand take the limit \\Delta x\\to 0:\\frac{df}{dx}&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0 }\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x}\\\\\n&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0 }(2x+\\Delta x)\\\\\n&=2x\n\nWe have thus found that the function, f'(x)=2x, is the derivative of the function f(x)=x^2.

We can proceed analogously for a function of multiple variables, f(x,y), by quantifying how much the function changes along the direction associated with a particular variable. This is illustrated in \n\nFigure 4 for the function f(x,y)=x^2-2y^2, which looks somewhat like a saddle.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:f(x,y)=x^2-2y^2 plotted for x between -5 and +5 and for y between -5 and +5. The point P labelled on the figure shows the value of the function at f(-2,-2). The two lines show the function evaluated when one of x or y is held constant.\n\nSuppose that we wish to determine the derivative of the function f(x,y) at x=-2 and y=-2. In this case, it does not make sense to simply determine the “derivative”, but rather, we must specify in which direction we want the derivative. That is, we need to specify in which direction we are interested in quantifying the rate of change of the function.\n\nOne possibility is to quantify the rate of change in the x direction. The solid line in \n\nFigure 4 shows the part of the function surface where y is fixed at -2, that is, the function evaluated as f(x,y=-2). The point P on the figure shows the value of the function when x=-2 and y=-2. By looking at the solid line at point P, we can see that as x increases, the value of the function is gently decreasing. The derivative of f(x,y) with respect to x when y is held constant and evaluated at x=-2 and y=-2 is thus negative. Rather than saying “The derivative of f(x,y) with respect to x when y is held constant” we say “The partial derivative of f(x,y) with respect to x”.\n\nSince the partial derivative is different than the ordinary derivative (as it implies that we are holding independent variables fixed), we give it a different symbol, namely, we use ∂ instead of d:\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}f(x,y)\\text{ (Partial derivative of f with respect to x)}\n\nCalculating the partial derivative is very easy, as we just treat all variables as constants except for the variable with respect to which we are differentiating. For the function f(x,y)=x^2-2y^2, we have:\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(x^2-2y^2\\right) = 2x\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(x^2-2y^2\\right) = -4y\n\nAt x=-2, the partial derivative of f(x,y) is indeed negative, consistent with our observation that, along the solid line, at point P, the function is decreasing.\n\nA function will have as many partial derivatives as it has independent variables. Also note that, just like a normal derivative, a partial derivative is still a function. The partial derivative with respect to a variable tells us how steep the function is in the direction in which that variable increases and whether it is increasing or decreasing.\n\nExample\n\nDetermine the partial derivatives of f(x,y,z)=ax^2+byz-\\sin(z).\n\nSolution\n\nIn this case, we have three partial derivatives to evaluate. Note that a are b constants and can be thought of as numbers that we do not know.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(ax^2+byz-\\sin(z)\\right) = 2ax\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(ax^2+byz-\\sin(z)\\right) = bz \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(ax^2+byz-\\sin(z)\\right) = by-\\cos(z)\n\nSince the partial derivatives tell us how the function changes in a particular direction, we can use them to find the direction in which the function changes the most rapidly. For example, suppose that the surface from \n\nFigure 4 corresponds to a real physical surface and that we place a ball at point P. We wish to know in which direction the ball will roll. The direction that it will roll in is the opposite of the direction where f(x,y) increases the most rapidly (i.e. it will roll in the direction where f(x,y) decreases the most rapidly). The direction in which the function increases the most rapidly is called the “gradient” and denoted by \\nabla f(x,y).\n\nSince the gradient is a direction, it cannot be represented by a single number. Rather, we use a “vector” to indicate this direction. Since f(x,y) has two independent variables, the gradient will be a vector with two components. The components of the gradient are given by the partial derivatives:\\nabla f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\hat x+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\hat y\n\nwhere \\hat x and \\hat y are the unit vectors in the x and y directions, respectively (sometimes, the unit vectors are denoted \\hat i and \\hat j). The direction of the gradient tells us in which direction the function increases the fastest, and the magnitude of the gradient tells us how much the function increases in that direction.\n\nExample\n\nDetermine the gradient of the function f(x,y)=x^2-2y^2 at the point x=-2 and y=-2.\n\nSolution\n\nWe have already found the partial derivatives that we need to evaluate at x=-2 and y=-2:\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}&= 2x\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}&= -4y \\\\\n\\therefore \\nabla f(x,y) &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\hat x+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\hat y \\\\\n&=2x\\hat x-4y\\hat y\n\nEvaluating the gradient at x=-2 and y=-2:\\nabla f(x,y) &= 2x\\hat x-4y\\hat y\\\\\n&=-4 \\hat x + 8 \\hat y\\\\\n&=4 (-\\hat x+2\\hat y)\\\\\n\nThe gradient vector points in the direction (-1,2). That is, the function increases the most in the direction where you would take 1 pace in the negative x direction and 2 paces in the positive y direction. You can confirm this by looking at point P in \n\nFigure 4 and imagining in which direction you would have to go to climb the surface to get the steepest climb.\n\nThe gradient is itself a function, but it is not a real function (in the sense of a real number), since it evaluates to a vector. It is a mapping from real numbers x,y to a vector. As you take more advanced calculus courses, you will eventually encounter “vector calculus”, which is just the calculus for functions of multiple variables to which you were just introduced. The key point to remember here is that the gradient can be used to find the vector that points in the direction of maximal increase of the corresponding multi-variate function. This is precisely the quantity that we need in physics to determine in which direction a ball will roll when placed on a surface (it will roll in the direction opposite to the gradient vector).\n\nCheckpoint\n\nThe gradient of a function of one variable, f(x), is\n\nundefined\n\nzero\n\nequal to its derivative\n\ninfinite\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/calculus#sec-calculus-gradients","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl3":"Common uses of derivatives in physics","lvl2":"Derivatives"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/calculus#common-uses-of-derivatives-in-physics","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl3":"Common uses of derivatives in physics","lvl2":"Derivatives"},"content":"The simplest case of using a derivative is to describe the speed of an object.

The derivative is useful because it tells us how the function f(x) varies as a function of x. In physics, we often know how a function varies, but we do not know the actual function. In other words, we often have the opposite problem: we are given the derivative of a function, and wish to determine the actual function. For this case, we will limit our discussion to functions of a single independent variable.\n\nSuppose that we are given a function f(x) and we know that this is the derivative of some other function, F(x), which we do not know. We call F(x) the anti-derivative of f(x). The anti-derivative of a function f(x), written F(x), thus satisfies the property:\\frac{dF}{dx}=f(x)\n\nSince we have a symbol for indicating that we take the derivative with respect to x (\\frac{d}{dx}), we also have a symbol, \\int dx, for indicating that we take the anti-derivative with respect to x:\\int f(x) dx &= F(x) \\\\\n\\therefore \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\int f(x) dx\\right) &= \\frac{dF}{dx}=f(x)\n\nEarlier, we justified the symbol for the derivative by pointing out that it is like \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x} but for the case when \\Delta x\\to 0. Similarly, we will justify the anti-derivative sign, \\int f(x) dx, by showing that it is related to a sum of f(x)\\Delta x, in the limit \\Delta x\\to 0. The \\int sign looks like an “S” for sum.\n\nWhile it is possible to exactly determine the derivative of a function f(x), the anti-derivative can only be determined up to a constant. Consider for example a different function, \\tilde F(x)=F(x)+C, where C is a constant. The derivative of \\tilde F(x) with respect to x is given by:\\frac{d\\tilde{F}}{dx}&=\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(F(x)+C\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{dF}{dx}+\\frac{dC}{dx}\\\\\n&=\\frac{dF}{dx}+0\\\\\n&=f(x)\n\nHence, the function \\tilde F(x)=F(x)+C is also an anti-derivative of f(x). The constant C can often be determined using additional information (sometimes called “initial conditions”). Recall the function, f(x)=x^2, shown in \n\nFigure 3 (left panel). If you imagine shifting the whole function up or down, the derivative would not change. In other words, if the origin of the axes were not drawn on the left panel, you would still be able to determine the derivative of the function (how steep it is). Adding a constant, C, to a function is exactly the same as shifting the function up or down, which does not change its derivative. Thus, when you know the derivative, you cannot know the value of C, unless you are also told that the function must go through a specific point (a so-called initial condition).\n\nIn order to determine the derivative of a function, we used equation \n\n(4). We now need to derive an equivalent prescription for determining the anti-derivative. Suppose that we have the two pieces of information required to determine F(x) completely, namely:\n\nthe function f(x)=\\frac{dF}{dx} (its derivative).\n\nthe condition that F(x) must pass through a specific point, F(x_0)=F_0.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:Determining the anti-derivative, F(x), given the function f(x)=2x and the initial condition that F(x) passes through the point (x_0,F_0)=(1,3).\n\nThe procedure for determining the anti-derivative F(x) is illustrated above in \n\nFigure 5. We start by drawing the point that we know the function F(x) must go through, (x_0,F_0). We then choose a value of \\Delta x and use the derivative, f(x), to calculate \\Delta F_0, the amount by which F(x) changes when x changes by \\Delta x. Using the derivative f(x) evaluated at x_0, we have:\\frac{\\Delta F_0}{\\Delta x} &\\approx f(x_0)\\;\\;\\;\\; (\\text{in the limit} \\Delta x\\to 0 )\\\\\n\\therefore \\Delta F_0 &= f(x_0) \\Delta x\n\nWe can then estimate the value of the function F_1=F(x_1) at the next point, x_1=x_0+\\Delta x, as illustrated by the black arrow in \n\nFigure 5F_1&=F(x_1)\\\\\n&=F(x+\\Delta x) \\\\\n&\\approx F_0 + \\Delta F_0\\\\\n&\\approx F_0+f(x_0)\\Delta x\n\nNow that we have determined the value of the function F(x) at x=x_1, we can repeat the procedure to determine the value of the function F(x) at the next point, x_2=x_1+\\Delta x. Again, we use the derivative evaluated at x_1, f(x_1), to determine \\Delta F_1, and add that to F_1 to get F_2=F(x_2), as illustrated by the grey arrow in \n\nFigure 5:F_2&=F(x_1+\\Delta x) \\\\\n&\\approx F_1+\\Delta F_1\\\\\n&\\approx F_1+f(x_1)\\Delta x\\\\\n&\\approx F_0+f(x_0)\\Delta x+f(x_1)\\Delta x\n\nUsing the summation notation, we can generalize the result and write the function F(x) evaluated at any point, x_N=x_0+N\\Delta x:F(x_N) \\approx F_0+\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} f(x_{i-1}) \\Delta x\n\nThe result above will become exactly correct in the limit \\Delta x\\to 0:F(x_N) = F(x_0)+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} f(x_{i-1}) \\Delta x\n\nLet us take a closer look at the sum. Each term in the sum is of the form f(x_{i-1})\\Delta x, and is illustrated in \n\nFigure 6 for the same case as in \n\nFigure 5 (that is, \n\nFigure 6 shows f(x) that we know, and \n\nFigure 5 shows F(x) that we are trying to find).\n\n\n\nFigure 6:The function f(x)=2x and illustration of the terms f(x_0)\\Delta x and f(x_1)\\Delta x as the area between the curve f(x) and the x axis when \\Delta x\\to 0.\n\nAs you can see, each term in the sum corresponds to the area of a rectangle between the function f(x) and the x axis (with a piece missing). In the limit where \\Delta x\\to 0, the missing pieces (shown by the hashed areas in \n\nFigure 6) will vanish and f(x_i)\\Delta x will become exactly the area between f(x) and the x axis over a length \\Delta x. The sum of the rectangular areas will thus approach the area between f(x) and the  x axis between x_0 and x_N:\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} f(x_{i-1}) \\Delta x=\\text{Area between f(x) and x axis from $x_0$ to $x_N$}\n\nRe-arranging equation \n\n(29) gives us a prescription for determining the anti-derivative:F(x_N) - F(x_0)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} f(x_{i-1}) \\Delta x\n\nWe see that if we determine the area between f(x) and the x axis from x_0 to x_N, we can obtain the difference between the anti-derivative at two points, F(x_N)-F(x_0)\n\nThe difference between the anti-derivative, F(x), evaluated at two different values of x is called the integral of f(x) and has the following notation:\\boxed{\\int_{x_0}^{x_N}f(x) dx=F(x_N) - F(x_0)=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} f(x_{i-1}) \\Delta x}\n\nAs you can see, the integral has labels that specify the range over which we calculate the area between f(x) and the x axis. A common notation to express the difference F(x_N) - F(x_0) is to use brackets:\\int_{x_0}^{x_N}f(x) dx=F(x_N) - F(x_0) =\\big [ F(x) \\big]_{x_0}^{x_N}\n\nRecall that we wrote the anti-derivative with the same \\int symbol earlier:\\int f(x) dx = F(x)\n\nThe symbol \\int f(x) dx without the limits is called the indefinite integral. You can also see that when you take the (definite) integral (i.e. the  difference between F(x) evaluated at two points), any constant that is added to F(x) will cancel. Physical quantities are always based on definite integrals, so when we write the constant C it is primarily for completeness and to emphasize that we have an indefinite integral.\n\nAs an example, let us determine the integral of f(x)=2x between x=1 and x=4, as well as the indefinite integral of f(x), which is the case that we illustrated in Figures \\ref{fig:Calculus:fint} and \\ref{fig:Calculus:fintarea}. Using equation \n\n(32), we have:\\int_{x_0}^{x_N}f(x) dx&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} f(x_{i-1}) \\Delta x \\\\\n&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} 2x_{i-1} \\Delta x\n\nwhere we have:x_0 &=1 \\\\\nx_N &=4 \\\\\n\\Delta x &= \\frac{x_N-x_0}{N}\n\nNote that N is the number of times we have \\Delta x in the interval between x_0 and x_N. Thus, taking the limit of \\Delta x\\to 0 is the same as taking the limit N\\to\\infty. Let us illustrate the sum for the case where N=3, and thus when \\Delta x=1, corresponding to the illustration in \n\nFigure 6:\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N=3} 2x_{i-1} \\Delta x &=2x_0\\Delta x+2x_1\\Delta x+2x_2\\Delta x\\\\\n&=2\\Delta x (x_0+x_1+x_2) \\\\\n&=2 \\frac{x_3-x_0}{N}(x_0+x_1+x_2) \\\\\n&=2 \\frac{(4)-(1)}{(3)}(1+2+3) \\\\\n&=12\n\nwhere in the second line, we noticed that we could factor out the 2\\Delta x because it appears in each term. Since we only used 4 points, this is a pretty coarse approximation of the integral, and we expect it to be an underestimate (as the missing area represented by the hashed lines in \n\nFigure 6 is quite large).\n\nIf we repeat this for a larger value of N, N=6 (\\Delta x = 0.5), we should obtain a more accurate answer:\\sum_{i=1}^{i=6} 2x_{i-1} \\Delta x &=2 \\frac{x_6-x_0}{N}(x_0+x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5)\\\\\n&=2\\frac{4-1}{6} (1+1.5+2+2.5+3+3.5)\\\\\n&=13.5\n\nWriting this out again for the general case so that we can take the limit N\\to\\infty, and factoring out the 2\\Delta x:\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} 2x_{i-1} \\Delta x &=2 \\Delta x\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}x_{i-1}\\\\\n&=2 \\frac{x_N-x_0}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}x_{i-1}\n\nNow, consider the combination:\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}x_{i-1}\n\nthat appears above. This corresponds to the arithmetic average of the values from x_0 to x_{N-1} (sum the values and divide by the number of values). In the limit where N\\to \\infty, then the value x_{N-1}\\approx x_N. The average value of x in the interval between x_0 and x_N is simply given by the value of x at the midpoint of the interval:\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}x_{i-1}=\\frac{1}{2}(x_N+x_0)\n\nPutting everything together:\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} 2x_{i-1} \\Delta x &=2 (x_N+x_0)\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}x_{i-1}\\\\\n&=2 (x_N-x_0)\\frac{1}{2}(x_N+x_0)\\\\\n&=x_N^2 - x_0^2\\\\\n&=(4)^2 - (1)^2 = 15\n\nwhere in the last line, we substituted in the values of x_0=1 and x_N=4. Writing this as the integral:\\int_{x_0}^{x_N}2x dx=F(x_N) - F(x_0)=x_N^2 - x_0^2\n\nwe can immediately identify the anti-derivative and the indefinite integral:F(x) &= x^2 +C \\\\\n\\int 2xdx&=x^2 +C\n\nThis is of course the result that we expected, and we can check our answer by taking the derivative of F(x):\\frac{dF}{dx}=\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2+C) = 2x\n\nWe have thus confirmed that F(x)=x^2+C is the anti-derivative of f(x)=2x.\n\nCheckpoint\n\nThe quantity \\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt is equal to\n\nthe area between the function f(t) and the f axis between t=a and t=b\n\nthe sum of f(t)\\Delta t in the limit \\Delta t\\to 0 between t=a and t=b\n\nthe difference f(b) - f(a).\n\nAnswer\n\n","type":"content","url":"/calculus#sec-calculus-integrals","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl3":"Common anti-derivative and properties","lvl2":"Anti-derivatives and integrals"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/calculus#common-anti-derivative-and-properties","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl3":"Common anti-derivative and properties","lvl2":"Anti-derivatives and integrals"},"content":"Table 3 below gives the anti-derivatives (indefinite integrals) for common functions.

If we assume that our mathematician friends (or computers) can determine anti-derivatives for us, using integrals is not that complicated.\n\nThe key idea in physics is that integrals are a tool to easily performing sums. As we saw above, integrals correspond to the area underneath a curve, which is found by summing the (different) areas of an infinite number of infinitely small rectangles. In physics, it is often the case that we need to take the sum of an infinite number of small things that keep varying, just as the areas of the rectangles.\n\nConsider, for example, a rod of length, L, and total mass M, as shown in \n\nFigure 7. If the rod is uniform in density, then if we cut it into, say, two equal pieces, those two pieces will weigh the same. We can define a “linear mass density”, μ, for the rod, as the mass per unit length of the rod:\\mu = \\frac{M}{L}\n\nThe linear mass density has dimensions of mass over length and can be used to find the mass of any length of rod. For example, if the rod has a mass of M=5 {\\rm kg} and a length of L=2 {\\rm m}, then the mass density is:\\mu=\\frac{M}{L}=\\frac{(5 {\\rm kg})}{(2 {\\rm m})}=2.5 {\\rm kg/m}\n\nKnowing the mass density, we can now easily find the mass, m, of a piece of rod that has a length of, say, l=10 {\\rm cm}. Using the mass density, the mass of the 10 {\\rm cm} rod is given by:m=\\mu l=(2.5 {\\rm kg/m})(0.1 {\\rm m})=0.25 {\\rm kg}\n\nNow suppose that we have a rod of length L that is not uniform, as in \n\nFigure 7, and that does not have a constant linear mass density. Perhaps the rod gets wider and wider, or it has holes in it that make it not uniform. Imagine that the mass density of the rod is instead given by a function, \\mu(x), that depends on the position along the rod, where x is the distance measured from one side of the rod.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:A rod with a varying linear density. To calculate the mass of the rod, we consider a small mass element \\Delta m_i of length \\Delta x at position x_i. The total mass of the rod is found by summing the mass of the small mass elements.\n\nNow, we cannot simply determine the mass of the rod by multiplying \\mu(x) and L, since we do not know which value of x to use. In fact, we have to use all of the values of x, between x=0 and x=L.\n\nThe strategy is to divide the rod up into N pieces of length \\Delta x. If we label our pieces of rod with an index i, we can say that the piece that is at position x_i has a tiny mass, \\Delta m_i. We assume that \\Delta x is small enough so that \\mu(x) can be taken as constant over the length of that tiny piece of rod. Then, the tiny piece of rod at x=x_i, has a mass, \\Delta m_i, given by:\\Delta m_i = \\mu(x_i) \\Delta x\n\nwhere \\mu(x_i) is evaluated at the position, x_i, of our tiny piece of rod. The total mass, M, of the rod is then the sum of the masses of the tiny rods, in the limit where \\Delta x\\to 0:M &= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}\\Delta m_i \\\\\n  &= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \\mu(x_i) \\Delta x\n\nBut this is precisely the definition of the integral (equation \n\n(29)), which we can easily evaluate with an anti-derivative:M &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \\mu(x_i) \\Delta x \\\\\n  &= \\int_0^L \\mu(x) dx \\\\\n  &= G(L) - G(0)\n\nwhere G(x) is the anti-derivative of \\mu(x).\n\nSuppose that the mass density is given by the function:\\mu(x)=ax^3\n\nwith anti-derivative (Table \\ref{tab:Calculus:commonints}):G(x)=a\\frac{1}{4}x^4 + C\n\nLet a=5 {\\rm kg/m^4} and let’s say that the length of the rod is L=0.5 {\\rm m}. The total mass of the rod is then:M&=\\int_0^L \\mu(x) dx \\\\\n&=\\int_0^L ax^3 dx \\\\\n&= G(L)-G(0)\\\\\n&=\\left[ a\\frac{1}{4}L^4 \\right] - \\left[ a\\frac{1}{4}0^4 \\right]\\\\\n&=5 {\\rm kg/m^4}\\frac{1}{4}(0.5 {\\rm m})^4 \\\\\n&=78 {\\rm g}\\\\\n\nWith a little practice, you can solve this type of problem without writing out the sum explicitly. Picture an infinitesimal piece of the rod of length dx at position x. It will have an infinitesimal mass, dm, given by:dm = \\mu(x) dx\n\nThe total mass of the rod is the then the sum (i.e. the integral) of the mass elementsM = \\int dm\n\nand we really can think of the \\int sign as a sum, when the things being summed are infinitesimally small. In the above equation, we still have not specified the range in x over which we want to take the sum; that is, we need some sort of index for the mass elements to make this a meaningful definite integral. Since we already know how to express dm in terms of dx, we can substitute our expression for dm using one with dx:M = \\int dm = \\int_0^L \\mu(x) dx\n\nwhere we have made the integral definite by specifying the range over which to sum, since we can use x to “label” the mass elements.\n\nOne should note that coming up with the above integral is physics. Solving it is math. We will worry much more about writing out the integral than evaluating its value. Evaluating the integral can always be done by a mathematician friend or a computer, but determining which integral to write down is the physicist’s job!","type":"content","url":"/calculus#common-uses-of-integrals-in-physics-from-a-sum-to-an-integral","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/calculus#summary","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix A - Calculus","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"The derivative of a function, f(x), with respect to x can be written as:\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)=\\frac{df}{dx}=f'(x)\n\nand measures the rate of change of the function with respect to x. The derivative of a function is generally itself a function. The derivative is defined as:f'(x) = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0}\\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\n\nGraphically, the derivative of a function represents the slope of the function, and it is positive if the function is increasing, negative if the function is decreasing and zero if the function is flat.  Derivatives can always be determined analytically for any continuous function.\n\nA partial derivative measures the rate of change of a multi-variate function, f(x,y), with respect to one of its independent variables. The partial derivative with respect to one of the variables is evaluated by taking the derivative of the function with respect to that variable while treating all other independent variables as if they were constant. The partial derivative of a function (with respect to x) is written as:\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\n\nThe gradient of a function, \\nabla f(x,y), is a vector in the direction in which that function is increasing most rapidly. It is given by:\\nabla f(x,y)=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\hat x + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\hat y\n\nGiven a function, f(x), its anti-derivative with respect to x, F(x), is written:F(x) = \\int f(x) dx\n\nF(x) is such that its derivative with respect to x is f(x):\\frac{dF}{dx}=f(x)\n\nThe anti-derivative of a function is only ever defined up to a constant, C. We usually write this as:\\int f(x) dx = F(x) + C\n\nsince the derivative of F(x) +C will also be equal to f(x). The anti-derivative is also called the “indefinite integral” of f(x).\n\nThe definite integral of a function f(x), between x=a and x=b, is written:\\int_a^b f(x) dx\n\nand is equal to the difference in the anti-derivative evaluated at x=a and x=b:\\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\nwhere the constant C no longer matters, since it cancels out. Physical quantities only ever depend on definite integrals, since they must be determined without an arbitrary constant.\n\nDefinite integrals are very useful in physics because they are related to a sum.

Of course, this is arbitrary, and the scale could be considered any length desired, and the programming would need to match the chosen scale. Notice the color is defined with color=color.green. It is important to define colors this way, i.e., with the “color-dot” format. Readily available colors are red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, orange, purple, and white. The radius variable is often chosen based on the scale of motion that will be simultated.

One way to make the ball move is to repeatedly update the position using kinematic descriptions of motion. If we define an object’s position as \\vec r, the object will change position over time as\\vec r(t + \\Delta t) = \\vec r(t) + \\vec v\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\vec a\\Delta t^2\n\nSuppose we want to model a situation where there is not acceleration. We could write lines of code that take the current position \\vec r(t) and update it with some amount \\vec v\\Delta t. Since we are in a 3D world, we must do this with vectors. For simplicity, let’s assume the velocity is only the x-direction that is a speed of v = 0.5 {\\rm m/s}, i.e., ball.vel=vec(0.5,0,0). Suppose we want to update every second, i.e., t = 0, 1, 2, 3,... or \\Delta t = 1.

Copy the code above run these lines in the trinket below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:A blank trinket ready to begin programming.\n\nYou will see that your program runs all of the lines instantly, and you do not see the motion. Slow the computation down by adding the command rate(1) between each line updating the ball’s position. This will delay each line by 1 second. For example,ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.vel * dt\nrate(1)\nball.pos = ball.pos + ball.vel * dt\nrate(1)\n\nIt might also be helpful to keep track of the time and position. To do this, create a variable for time, t, and add print statements between each move. Notice below that we can access the x position with ball.pos.x.ball = sphere(pos=vec(0,0,0), radius=0.1, color=color.red)\nball.vel=vec(0.5, 0, 0)\nt = 0\ndt = 1\nprint(t, ball.pos.x)\nrate(1)\nball.pos = ball.pos + ball.vel * dt #move ball after 1s\nt = t + dt #increase the total time\nprint(t, ball.pos.x)\nrate(1)\nball.pos = ball.pos + ball.vel * dt #move ball after 2s\nt = t + dt #increase the total time\nprint(t, ball.pos.x)\nrate(1)\nball.pos = ball.pos + ball.vel * dt #move ball after 3s\nt = t + dt #increase the total time\nprint(t, ball.pos.x)\nrate(1)\nball.pos = ball.pos + ball.vel * dt # move ball after 4s\nt = t + dt #increase the total time\nprint(t, ball.pos.x)\nrate(1)\nball.pos = ball.pos + ball.vel * dt # move ball after 5s\nt = t + dt #increase the total time\nprint(t, ball.pos.x)\n\nFinally, let’s make the ball’s motion obvious by adding a trail to it.

To make the process more streamlined, we use loops. In this case, we will use a while loop. The while loop runs “while” a condition is met. For example, we can run the ball simulation while the time is less than 5 seconds. Because the loop streamlines the computation, we can get higher time resolution and update the position every 0.1 second. A while loop looks similar to a for loop.while t < 5:\n\nSince we are using the total time as the condition for the while loop, it is important to keep track of the total time as we did in the previous section.

In practice, scientists do not have a lab full of equipment ready to go and to be used for testing whichever theory suits their fancy. Instead, they need to write a “proposal” for conducting a particular experiment to a funding source (e.g. a funding agency). That funding source will then select a panel of experts in the field to review whether the proposal is feasible and useful in advancing science, to decide whether it should be funded. If the scientist is awarded with funds, they are then expected to carry out their experiment and report on the results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Again, before the results are published, the scientific journal will ask a panel of experts to review the results to ensure that they are scientifically valid and interesting.\n\nIn order for a proposal to be funded, it must thus propose an experiment that is well-thought out and feasible. For example, the reviewers will want to make sure that the proposed experiment is designed in the best possible way to test a theory. Often, this means that thought has been put into designing an experiment that minimizes the uncertainty on the result, so that the test of the theory is as stringent as possible.\n\nA proposal needs to be well-written and precise. We generally call this type of writing “scientific writing”, and it is a style of writing that takes some practice. Similarly, when reporting on the results of an experiment, the report will need to be clear and precise as well. For example, in scientific writing, one avoids giving opinions or using sentences that do not add necessary information or that are not factual.\n\nThis chapter provides some guidelines for scientific writing, writing proposals, and writing reports. In addition to this, guidelines for reviewing others’ proposals and reports are also presented. Not only is it important to develop the ability to critically evaluate others’ work, but it is also helpful in learning to reflect and improve on one’s own work.","type":"content","url":"/labs#the-process-of-science-and-the-need-for-scientific-writing","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Scientific writing"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/labs#scientific-writing","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Scientific writing"},"content":"Scientific writing is important in communicating with other scientists. Think of scientific writing as a style of writing where every word counts. It makes for rather “dry” reading, but it is important for clearly and precisely communicating factual information. The main guidelines for scientific writing are be concise, precise, factual, and clear. Below are some tips to help with scientific writing:\n\nAvoid subjective/imprecise terms: avoid using subjective and imprecise terms, stick to factual statements and avoid opinions.  Instead of saying “our calculated value of g was much greater than the expected value”, say “our calculated value of g was greater than the expected value”. Your opinion that it was ‘‘much greater’’ does not communicate anything and is imprecise (much greater in relation to what?).\n\nDefinitive statements: avoid attributing definitive causes to your experimental outcomes. You can never prove a theory to be correct, so at most, your results will be consistent with a theory. For example, instead of saying “as the data exhibit, we have detected the Purple Particle”, you should state that “the data are consistent with the detection of the Purple Particle”.\n\nData is the plural of datum. “This data shows” is incorrect, rather, “these data show”, or “this set of data shows”.\n\nActive vs. passive voice: when writing scientific papers, it is recommended to use the third person, passive voice. For example, this would mean saying “the drop time for balls at various heights was measured” rather than “we measured the drop time for balls at various heights”. However, both passive and active voices are acceptable in scientific writing, as long as it is consistent throughout the text.\n\nTense. Generally, for a proposal, you would use the future tense, and you would use the past tense for reporting on your results.\n\nEmma’s Thoughts\n\nWriting and editing - how can I be more concise?\nWe’ve all felt that our writing was lacking at some point or another. Here are some general tips to avoid overall “wordiness” and to increase ease of reading when writing scientifically:\n\nWhat would you want to read? Let’s say that you wanted to know the strength of Earth’s magnetic field, and how it was found, so you decide to do a literature search. Would you choose a brief, succinct article, or a wordy Magnetic Field Manifesto?\n\nThe kindergarten test: If you had to explain your concept to a six year old cousin, how would you break it down in a way that they could understand it? If you can’t break it down enough to explain to a six year old, perhaps you need to revisit your own understanding of the concept before writing about it scientifically.\n\nAvoid unnecessary adjectives: while this might be ok in a creative writing class, in scientific writing, the goal is to get your point across as succinctly as possible. Using “big” words might be ok (as long as they properly describe what you are trying to say), but it is important to communicate your message in the simplest manner.\n\nThink about it: every time you use a comma, dash or even an “and”, you should reconsider the brevity of your statement. In scientific writing, commas are carefully placed, and semicolons are rare.\n\nCut it in half: For every word you read, think of another that you can cut. For every sentence that you read, think of three sentences that communicate the same idea. Pick the sentence that is the shortest and most concise.\n\nProofread - the more, the better.\n\nThe following sections provide basic outlines for writing a proposal and a lab report, as well as rubrics for evaluating/reviewing proposals and reports. Additionally, samples of a proposal, proposal review, report, and report review for the experiment “Measuring g using a pendulum” are provided. In the sample proposal and lab report, errors are purposefully included and addressed in the reviews. It is important to entirely read the rest of this section to capture the common proposal/lab mistakes and their corresponding corrections. That is, do not take the sample proposal as a “perfect proposal”, but rather, consider it in the light of the corresponding review.","type":"content","url":"/labs#scientific-writing","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Guide for writing a proposal"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/labs#guide-for-writing-a-proposal","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Guide for writing a proposal"},"content":"Summary and Goal\n\nWrite a few short sentences briefly summarizing the aim of your experiment, how it will be conducted, and how precise of a result you expect to obtain.\n\nMethod and equipment\n\nClearly describe, in as much detail as required, the method/procedure that you will use to carry out your experiment, and how you will analyse the results.

Because the experimental design can be easily adjusted and the experiment is simple, the experiment has a high chance of success.\n\nMethod and equipment\n\nThe period of a pendulum of length L is easily shown to be given by:T=2\\pi \\sqrt {\\frac{L}{g}}\n\nThus, by measuring the period, T, of a pendulum as well as its length, one can determine the value of g:g=\\frac{4\\pi^{2}L}{T^{2}}\n\nOne can carry out the experiment using the following materials:\n\na mass\n\ninextensible string\n\na metre stick\n\nstand to attach string\n\ncell-phone with timer and slow-motion camera\n\nThe materials listed above are all inexpensive and can be easily obtained.  It is recommended that the experiment be completed indoors at room temperature, in order to minimize any environmental effects.\n\nOne should tie the string to the mass at one end and the stand at the other, and measure the length, L, of the string from the point on the stand to the centre of mass of the mass.\n\nThe period of the pendulum is measured by timing how long it takes the pendulum to complete 20 oscillations and dividing that time by 20. This will be more precise than trying to time the period of a single oscillation.\n\nThe pendulum should be released from 90\\degree. When releasing the pendulum, the string should be pulled taught, and the team member’s eye that is measuring the angle should be situated parallel to the measuring device.\n\nA slow-motion video will be taken of the pendulum to track the time of the oscillation in order to minimize error due to reaction time. The team member in charge of taking the video will start the video shortly before the pendulum is released. After releasing the pendulum, the team should record 20 oscillations before stopping the pendulum and the video. Data from the video should be entered into a Jupyter Notebook. It is recommended that this measurement be repeated at least 5 times.\n\nThe uncertainty in the time should be taken as half of the smallest division of the cell-phone timer, and the uncertainty in the length of the pendulum as half the smallest division of the metre stick used to measure the length of the pendulum.\n\nForeseeable issues in this experiment may arise when trying to find a string that is optimally inextensible, as any extensibility will cause error in the results. Additionally, being able to measure exactly 90\\degree as the drop-angle for the pendulum could be difficult. In order to correct for this, the team member who is dropping the pendulum must stand directly parallel to the measuring device, minimizing parallax error.\n\nThe measure of success will be determined by the uncertainty and precision of the measured value of g. If the measured value of g has a relative uncertainty that is less than 10 %, and is consistent with the accepted value, then one can consider the experiment to have been carried out successfully.\n\nTeam and timeline\n\nOne should be able to complete the experiment and analysis in approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes with the data being collected in the first 30 minutes. The remainder of the time should be spent processing the data and writing the experimental report.Following the strengths of the members of the team, the following people should be responsible for leading the following tasks, while everyone participates:\n\nAlice: building the pendulum\n\nBrice: taking the measurements\n\nChlo\"e: analysing the data\n\nDennis: writing and formatting","type":"content","url":"/labs#sample-proposal-measuring-g-using-a-pendulum","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Sample proposal review (Measuring g using a pendulum)"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/labs#sample-proposal-review-measuring-g-using-a-pendulum","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Sample proposal review (Measuring g using a pendulum)"},"content":"Summary and Goal\n\nThe authors propose to measure the value of g to within 10% by measuring the period of a simple pendulum, using the SHM equations and theory. The proposal is reasonably clear, but lacks some details in how to measure the initial angle of the pendulum. The authors propose to use a an amplitude of 90\\degree for the pendulum, but at such a large angle, the motion is not expected to be SHM, since it is only so at small angles. By using a smaller angle, the experiment has a good chance of being successful in the proposed timeline.\n\nReview\n\nThe experimental methods are described clearly and succinctly, with most information clearly stated. For the materials list, it is stated that “a mass” must be used. Here, it should be stated that a small, solid, non-deformable mass should be used to minimize drag and to act as a point mass. The authors refer to a “measuring device” when determining the amplitude of the pendulum, but this is not described. Anyhow, the amplitude of the oscillations in irrelevant for a pendulum in SHM, as long as the amplitude is small.\n\nMost equations are described in the theory section, but it is incorrectly assumed that the period of a pendulum is independent of the drop angle for all angles. The small angle approximation is not expected to apply with an oscillation amplitude of 90\\degree.\n\nNo justification is provided for the use of 20 oscillations prior to measuring the period - it may be necessary to iterate on the reason why 20 oscillations was chosen.\n\nThe equipment can be easily obtained and is fairly inexpensive. Adequate resources are available to the group to perform this experiment. A clear troubleshooting plan is described and a method for evaluating success is included.\n\nTimeline and team\n\nThis experiment is fairly simple and the equipment/setup is not difficult to handle. The proposed team should be qualified to perform this experiment in the proposed amount of time, although I worry a little bit about Dennis, as he seems to be a bit of a menace.\n\nOverall Rating of the Proposal\n\nGood - this proposal was clearly explained and is scientifically sound, apart from the use of a large angle for the oscillations. It was succinctly written, and most components of the experiment were clearly described. A little more detail in the justification for using 20 oscillations is necessary.","type":"content","url":"/labs#sample-proposal-review-measuring-g-using-a-pendulum","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Sample lab report (Measuring g using a pendulum)"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/labs#sample-lab-report-measuring-g-using-a-pendulum","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Sample lab report (Measuring g using a pendulum)"},"content":"Abstract\n\nIn this experiment, we measured g by measuring the period of a pendulum of a known length. We measured g = 7.65\\pm 0.378 {\\rm m/s^2}. This correspond to a relative difference of 22% with the accepted value (9.8 {\\rm m/s^2}), and our result is not consistent with the accepted value.\n\nTheory\n\nA pendulum exhibits simple harmonic motion (SHM), which allowed us to measure the gravitational constant by measuring the period of the pendulum. The period, T, of a pendulum of length L undergoing simple harmonic motion is given by:T=2\\pi \\sqrt {\\frac{L}{g}}\n\nThus, by measuring the period of a pendulum as well as its length, we can determine the value of g:g=\\frac{4\\pi^{2}L}{T^{2}}\n\nWe assumed that the frequency and period of the pendulum depend on the length of the pendulum string, rather than the angle from which it was dropped.\n\nPredictions\n\nWe built the pendulum with a length L=1.0000\\pm 0.0005 {\\rm m} that was measured with a ruler with 1 {\\rm mm} graduations (thus a negligible uncertainty in L). We plan to measure the period of one oscillation by measuring the time to it takes the pendulum to go through 20 oscillations and dividing that by 20. The period for one oscillation, based on our value of L and the accepted value for g, is expected to be T=2.0 {\\rm s}. We expect that we can measure the time for 20 oscillations with an uncertainty of 0.5 {\\rm s}. We thus expect to measure one oscillation with an uncertainty of 0.025 {\\rm s} (about 1% relative uncertainty on the period). We thus expect that we should be able to measure g with a relative uncertainty of the order of 1%\n\nProcedure\n\nThe experiment was conducted in a laboratory indoors.\n\nConstruction of the pendulum\n\nWe constructed the pendulum by attaching a inextensible string to a stand on one end and to a mass on the other end. The mass, string and stand were attached together with knots. We adjusted the knots so that the length of the pendulum was 1.0000\\pm0.0005 {\\rm m}. The uncertainty is given by half of the smallest division of the ruler that we used.\n\nMeasurement of the period\n\nThe pendulum was released from 90\\degree and its period was measured by filming the pendulum with a cell-phone camera and using the phone’s built-in time. In order to minimize the uncertainty in the period, we measured the time for the pendulum to make 20 oscillations, and divided that time by 20. We repeated this measurement five times. We transcribed the measurements from the cell-phone into a Jupyter Notebook.\n\nData and Analysis\n\nUsing a 100 {\\rm g} mass and 1.0 {\\rm m} ruler stick, the period of 20 oscillations was measured over 5 trials. The corresponding value of g for each of these trials was calculated. The following data for each trial and corresponding value of g are shown in \n\nTable 1.\n\nTable 1:Results of five trials measuring a pendulum period.\n\nTrial\n\nAngle (Degrees)\n\nMeasured Period (s)\n\nValue of g ({\\rm m/s^2})\n\n1\n\n90\n\n2.24\n\n7.87\n\n2\n\n90\n\n2.37\n\n7.03\n\n3\n\n90\n\n2.28\n\n7.59\n\n4\n\n90\n\n2.26\n\n7.73\n\n5\n\n90\n\n2.22\n\n8.01\n\nOur final measured value of g is 7.65\\pm 0.378 {\\rm m/s^2}. This was calculated using the mean of the values of g from the last column and the corresponding standard deviation. The relative uncertainty on our measured value of g is 4.9% and the relative difference with the accepted value of 9.8 {\\rm m/s^2} is 22%, well above our relative uncertainty.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nIn this experiment, we measured g=7.65\\pm 0.378 {\\rm m/s^2}. This has a relative difference of 22% with the accepted value and our measured value is not consistent with the accepted value. All of our measured values were systematically lower than expected, as our measured periods were all systematically higher than the 2.0 {\\rm s} that we expected from our prediction. We also found that our measurement of g had a much larger uncertainty (as determined from the spread in values that we obtained), compared to the 1% relative uncertainty that we predicted.\n\nWe suspect that by using 20 oscillations, the pendulum slowed down due to friction, and this resulted in a deviation from simple harmonic motion. This is consistent with the fact that our measured periods are systematically higher. We also worry that we were not able to accurately measure the angle from which the pendulum was released, as we did not use a protractor.\n\nIf this experiment could be redone, measuring 10 oscillations of the pendulum, rather than 20 oscillations, could provide a more precise value of g. Additionally, a protractor could be taped to the top of the pendulum stand, with the ruler taped to the protractor. This way, the pendulum could be dropped from a near-perfect 90 {\\rm \\degree} rather than a rough estimate.","type":"content","url":"/labs#sample-lab-report-measuring-g-using-a-pendulum","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Sample lab report review (Measuring g using a pendulum)"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/labs#sample-lab-report-review-measuring-g-using-a-pendulum","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix C - Guidelines for lab related activities","lvl2":"Sample lab report review (Measuring g using a pendulum)"},"content":"Summary\n\nThe authors measured the period of a pendulum to determine g.
