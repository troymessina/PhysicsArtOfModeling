# Overview

This appendix gives a very brief introduction to calculus with a focus on the tools needed in physics. 
 
:::{hint} Learning Objectives
* Understand the trinket.io platform
* Understand how to create and position objects in trinket.
* Understand how to create motion with objects in trinket.
:::

# Code in this textbook
When referring to general ideas or something very brief, Visual Python code may be written in-line. For example, ```this is a general code statement```. When giving explicit code to be implemented, Visual Python code will be written in "display mode". For example,
```python
print("This code is meant to be implemented into a trinket.")
```
The distinction should become clear as you work through this appendix.

# The trinket.io platform

Trinket.io is web-based programming platform with a few different programming languages available,e.g., Python, Visual Python, R, Java, and HTML5. In this textbook, we will use primarily Visual Python, which is a language built on Python that allows Python programming to manipulate simulated objects in three-dimensional space. The trinket below is a Visual Python program that simulates a moon-like mass orbiting an Earth-like mass. Click the play button to see the simulation.

A few notes about the embedded trinkets in this book:
* The menu in the upper left corner allows full-screen viewing.
* The center bar between the code and the simulation can be adjusted to make the either consume more of the screen for easier viewing.
* If signed into trinket, readers should be able to click "Remix" in the upper right corner to save a trinket to their own account.

## Trinket accounts
The website trinket.io offers a variety of accounts. You can learn more about these at https://trinket.io/schools. The three main account modes trinket might be implemented in your course are
* with free accounts for everyone where the instructor shares pre-written shells for students to complete
* with free accounts for students and a pay account for the instructor. This allows the instructor to build trinket courses with assignments.
* with pay accounts for everyone that offers the most options.
